Therefore, our aim was to determine the effect of chronic lithium treatment on mechanical hypersensitivity and trabecular bone loss induced by T1DM in mice. T1DM was induced in male C57BL/6J mice by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ, 50\xa0mg/kg/day, for 5 consecutive days). 12 weeks after T1DM-induction, mice received a daily intraperitoneal injection of vehicle, 30 or 60\xa0mg/kg lithium (as LiCl) for 6 weeks.

After lithium treatment, the femur and L5 vertebra were harvested for microcomputed tomography (microCT) analysis. T1DM mice showed significant hyperglycemia, mechanical hypersensitivity, and significant trabecular bone loss as compared with the control group. Chronic lithium treatment did not revert the hindpaw mechanical hypersensitivity nor hyperglycemia associated to T1DM induced by STZ. In contrast, microCT analysis revealed that lithium reverted, in a dose-dependent manner, the loss of trabecular bone associated to T1DM induced by STZ at both the distal femur and L5 vertebra.

This review aims at summarizing current knowledge regarding miRNAs' biosynthesis and action pathways and their role as gene expression regulators in T1DM. MiRNAs follow a complex biosynthesis pathway, including cleaving and transport from nucleus to cytoplasm. After assembly of their final form, they inhibit translation or cause messenger RNA (mRNA) degradation, resulting in the obstruction of protein synthesis. Many studies have reported miRNA involvement in T1DM pathogenesis, mainly through interference with pancreatic b-cell function, insulin production and secretion. They are also found to contribute to β-cell destruction, as they aid in the production of autoreactive agents. Due to their elevated accumulation in various biological specimens, as well as their involvement in T1DM pathogenesis, their role as biomarkers in early preclinical T1DM diagnosis is widely hypothesized, with future studies concerning their diagnostic value deemed a necessity.""]"

It is known that one of the main manifestations of brain damage in type 1 diabetes is cognitive impairment, which is possibly associated with the peculiarities of vascularization and interhemispheric asymmetry, which requires in-depth analysis using modern neuroimaging methods. The aim of the study is to assess the symmetry of structural, metabolic and neurovascularization changes in the brain in patients with type 1 diabetes and cognitive impairment. The study included 120 patients with type 1 diabetes aged 18 to 45 years suffering from cognitive impairment, and 30 people without cognitive decline and the control group (n=30) healthy people without diabetes. Neuropsychological testing included the Montreal Cognitive Dysfunction Assessment Scale (MoCA test). For neuroimaging methods, standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), contrast and non-contrast-enhanced perfusion were used. Statistical processing was carried out using the SPSS Statistic 2020 software. In patients with type 1 diabetes with cognitive impairment, as manifested by impaired memory and/or attention, perfusion imaging revealed the presence of brain asymmetry zones. Standard MRI allowed to demonstrate changes in the white, gray matter and hippocampus in the right hemisphere. The results obtained were refined taking into account the topical localization, so during the perfusion study, regions with asymmetric blood flow were identified - namely, the white matter of the frontal lobe and the gray matter in the occipital lobe. Spectroscopy of the brain revealed that it was in these areas of the brain that the most significant metabolic disorders were noted - in the form of significantly altered ratio of N-acetylaspartate (NAA)/choline (Cho) on the left, along with the asymmetry in phosphocreatine level (Cr 2) on the right. In conclusion, early preclinical predictive diagnostics with the use of modern neuroimaging methods allows for timely detection of impaired vascularization and brain metabolism in this group of patients, However, decreased perfusion in the region within the region of frontal lobe white matter and temporal lobe grey matter, and hippocampal cell metabolism by spectra should be highlighted among the parameters Cr right and NAA/Cho left.']"

While insulin alleviates the primary dysfunction of the disease, many other aspects of the pathophysiology of type 1 diabetes mellitus are unaffected. Research aimed towards the discovery of novel type 1 diabetes mellitus therapeutics targeting different cell signaling pathways is gaining momentum. The focus of these efforts has been almost entirely on the impact of immunomodulatory drugs, particularly those that have already received FDA-approval for other autoimmune diseases. However, these drugs can often have severe side effects, while also putting already immunocompromised individuals at an increased risk for other infections. Potential therapeutic targets in the insulin-producing beta-cell have been largely ignored by the type 1 diabetes mellitus field, save the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor. While there is preliminary evidence to support the clinical exploration of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor-based drugs as type 1 diabetes mellitus adjuvant therapeutics, there is a vast space for other putative therapeutic targets to be explored. The alpha subunit of the heterotrimeric G<sub>z</sub> protein (Gα<sub>z</sub>) has been shown to promote beta-cell inflammation, dysfunction, death, and failure to replicate in the context of diabetes in a number of mouse models. Genetic loss of Gα<sub>z</sub> or inhibition of the Gα<sub>z</sub> signaling pathway through dietary interventions is protective against the development of insulitis and hyperglycemia. The multifaceted effects of Gα<sub>z</sub> in regards to beta-cell health in the context of diabetes make it an ideal therapeutic target for further study. It is our belief that a low-risk, effective therapy for type 1 diabetes mellitus will involve a multidimensional approach targeting a number of regulatory systems, not the least of which is the insulin-producing beta-cell. Impact statement The expanding investigation of beta-cell therapeutic targets for the treatment and prevention of type 1 diabetes mellitus is fundamentally relevant and timely. This review summarizes the overall scope of research into novel type 1 diabetes mellitus therapeutics, highlighting weaknesses or caveats in current clinical trials as well as describing potential new targets to pursue. More specifically, signaling proteins that act as modulators of beta-cell function, survival, and replication, as well as immune infiltration may need to be targeted to develop the most efficient pharmaceutical interventions for type 1 diabetes mellitus. One such beta-cell signaling pathway, mediated by the alpha subunit of the heterotrimeric G<sub>z</sub> protein (Gα<sub>z</sub>), is discussed in more detail. The work described here will be critical in moving the field forward as it emphasizes the central role of the beta-cell in type 1 diabetes mellitus disease pathology.']"

ONO-4641 was tested in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, an animal model of spontaneous type 1 diabetes mellitus, an autoimmune disease with unmet medical needs. ONO-4641 at a dose of 0.1\u2009mg/kg prevented the onset of diabetes mellitus in NOD mice. Furthermore, ONO-4641 at doses of 0.03 and 0.1\u2009mg/kg decreased diabetic prevalence in NOD mice after the onset of diabetes mellitus in a dose-dependent manner. Histopathological analysis demonstrated that insulin-positive areas in the islets of mice administered 0.03 and 0.1\u2009mg/kg ONO-4641 showed a tendency of high values although they were not significantly different from the Control group, which was treated with vehicle.

To investigate the effect and mechanism(s) of action of RVD1, an anti-inflammatory metabolite derived from docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), on STZ-induced type 1 DM in male Wistar rats, type 1 diabetes was induced by single intraperitoneal (i.p) streptozotocin (STZ-65 mg/kg) injection. RVD1 (60 ng/mL, given intraperitoneally) was administered from day 1 along with STZ for five consecutive days. Plasma glucose, IL-6, TNF-α, BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor that has anti-diabetic actions), LXA4 (lipoxin A4), and RVD1 levels and BDNF concentrations in the pancreas, liver, and brain tissues were measured. Apoptotic (<i>Bcl2/Bax</i>), inflammatory (<i>COX-1/COX-2/Nf-κb/iNOS/PPAR-γ</i>) genes and downstream insulin signaling proteins (Gsk-3β/Foxo1) were measured in the pancreatic tissue along with concentrations of various antioxidants and lipid peroxides. RVD1 decreased severity of STZ-induced type 1 DM by restoring altered plasma levels of TNF-α, IL-6, and BDNF (<i>p</i> < 0.001); expression of pancreatic <i>COX-1/COX-2/PPAR-γ</i> genes and downstream insulin signaling proteins (Gsk-3β/Foxo1) and the concentrations of antioxidants and lipid peroxides to near normal. RVD1 treatment restored expression of <i>Bcl2/Pdx</i> genes, plasma LXA4 (<i>p</i> < 0.001) and RVD1 levels and increased brain, pancreatic, intestine, and liver BDNF levels to near normal. The results of the present study suggest that RVD1 can prevent STZ-induced type 1 diabetes by its anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant actions and by activating the <i>Pdx</i> gene that is needed for pancreatic β cell proliferation.']"

Yet, several barriers to exercise in this population exist, such as post-exercise hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia. Several studies suggest that the timing of exercise may be an important factor in preventing exercise-induced hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia. However, there is a paucity of evidence solely focused on summarising findings regarding exercise timing and the impact it has on glucose metabolism in type 1 diabetes. This report suggests that resistance or high-intensity interval exercise/training (often known as HIIT) may be best commenced at the time of day when an individual is most likely to experience a hypoglycaemic event (i.e., afternoon/evening) due to the superior blood glucose stability resistance and HIIT exercise provides. Continuous aerobic-based exercise is advised to be performed in the morning due to circadian elevations in blood glucose at this time, thereby providing added protection against a hypoglycaemic episode. Ultimately, the evidence concerning exercise timing and glycaemic control remains at an embryonic stage. Carefully designed investigations of this nexus are required, which could be harnessed to determine the most effective, and possibly safest, time to exercise for those with type 1 diabetes.']"

Blood pressure (BP) and body sodium homeostasis are linked. T1DM patients have increased total exchangeable sodium, correlating directly with BP. Pressure natriuresis is an important physiological regulator of BP. We hypothesised that pressure natriuresis would be impaired, and BP increased, in the early phase of T1DM. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with streptozotocin (30-45\xa0mg/kg) or citrate vehicle. After 3\xa0weeks, pressure natriuresis was induced by serial arterial ligation. In non-diabetic controls, this increased fractional excretion of sodium from ∼1% to ∼25% of the filtered load (P\xa0< 0.01); in T1DM rats, the response was significantly blunted, peaking at only ∼3% (P\xa0< 0.01). Mechanistically, normal lithium clearance suggested that distal tubule sodium reabsorption was not downregulated with increased BP in T1DM rats. The pressure dependence of renal medullary perfusion, considered a key factor in the integrated response, was abolished. Insulin therapy rescued the natriuretic response in diabetic rats, restoring normal downregulation of tubular sodium reabsorption when BP was increased. However, the pressure dependence of medullary perfusion was not restored, suggesting persistent vascular dysfunction despite glycaemic control. Radiotelemetry showed that T1DM did not affect systolic BP, but mean diastolic BP was ∼5\xa0mmHg higher than in non-diabetic controls (P\xa0< 0.01), and normal diurnal variation was reduced.

To this end, pregnant mice were exposed to mixed PAHs (5, 50, or 500\xa0μg/kg) once every other day during gestation. The adult male offspring displayed impaired glucose tolerance and reduced serum levels of glucagon and insulin. Immunohistochemical staining revealed increased numbers of apoptotic β-cells and a reduced β-cell mass in these males. The downregulated expression of pancreatic estrogen receptor α, androgen receptor, and transcription factor PDX1 was responsible for impacting β-cell development. The relatively reduced α-cell area was associated with downregulated ARX expression. The transcription of Isn2 and Gcg in pancreatic tissue was downregulated, which indicated that the function of β-cells and α-cells was impaired. Methylation levels in the Isn2 promotor were significantly elevated in mice prenatally exposed to 500\xa0µg/kg PAHs, which was consistent with the change in its mRNA levels. The number of macrophages infiltrating islets was significantly increased, indicating that prenatal PAH exposure might reduce islet cell numbers in an autoimmune manner.

Physical exercise has been shown to have potentially beneficial protective roles against cytokine-induced pancreatic β-cell death, but its benefits are yet to be proved and should be understood better, especially in the islet environment. What is the main finding and its importance? Physical exercise protects against β-cell loss in a well-described animal model for T1D, induced by multiple low doses of streptozotocin. This seems to be related to reduced cytokine-induced β-cell death and increased islet cell proliferation. Contributions of islet neogenesis and/or transdifferentiation of pancreatic non-β-cells into β-cells cannot be excluded.', attributes={'Label': 'NEW FINDINGS'}), StringElement('Physical exercise has beneficial effects on pancreatic β-cell function and survival in a pro-inflammatory environment. Although these effects have been linked to decreased islet inflammation and modulation of pro-apoptotic pathways, little is known about the islet microenvironment. Our aim was to evaluate the effects of physical exercise in islet histomorphology in a mouse model of type\xa01 diabetes mellitus induced by multiple low doses of streptozotocin. As expected, induction of type\xa01 diabetes mellitus led to β-cell loss and, consequently, decreased islet area. Interestingly, although the decrease in islet area was not prevented by physical exercise, this was not the case for the decrease in β-cell mass. This was probably related to induction of β-cell regeneration, because we observed increased proliferation and regeneration markers, such as Ki67 and Pcna, in islets of trained mice. These were found in the central and peripheral regions of the islets. An increase in the percentage of α- and δ-cells in these conditions, combined with an increase in proliferation and Pax4 labelling in peripheral regions, suggest that β-cell regeneration might also occur by transdifferentiation. This agrees with the presence of cells double stained for insulin and glucagon only in islets of diabetic trained mice. In addition, this group had more extra-islet insulin-positive cells and islets associated with ducts than diabetic mice. Physical exercise also decreased nuclear factor-κB activation in islet cells of diabetic trained compared with diabetic untrained mice, indicating a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokine-induced β-cell death. Taken together, these findings indicate that preservation of β-cell mass induced by physical exercise involves an increase in β-cell replication and decrease in β-cell death, together with islet neogenesis and islet cell transdifferentiation.', attributes={'Label': 'ABSTRACT'})]"

Vitamin D formed profusely in the skin upon exposure to sunlight, as well as from dietary sources, exhibits an immunomodulatory effect based on gene transcription control. Indeed, vitamin D can downregulate mechanisms connected with adaptive immunity, induce immunological tolerance and decrease auto-aggression-related inflammation. These properties provide the basis for a preventive and therapeutic role of vitamin D. As many studies have demonstrated, appropriate supplementation with vitamin D reduces the risk of autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes mellitus, and alleviates disease symptoms in patients.

By their nature and function, β-cells are prone to biosynthetic stress with limited measures for self-defence. β-Cell stress provokes an immune attack that has considerable negative effects on the source of a vital hormone. This view would explain why immunotherapy at best delays progression of type 1 diabetes mellitus and points to opportunities to use therapies that revitalize β-cells, in combination with immune intervention strategies, to reverse the disease. We present the case that dysfunction occurs in both the immune system and β-cells, which provokes further dysfunction, and present the evidence leading to the consensus that islet autoimmunity is an essential component in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes mellitus. Next, we build the case for the β-cell as the trigger of an autoimmune response, supported by analogies in cancer and antitumour immunity. Finally, we synthesize a model ('connecting the dots') in which both β-cell stress and islet autoimmunity can be harnessed as targets for intervention strategies.""]"

Previous studies show that any imbalance in the population of different lymphocyte subsets could develop autoimmune diseases. Our theory is that enteroviral infection causes an impairment in the distribution of lymphocyte subtypes and consequently results in the diabetes onset in some individuals.

Although genetic background and abnormalities in immune response or viral infection are considered to be associated with pathogenesis of FT1D, it remains unclear whether virus infection and specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing are involved in DIHS-associated FT1D. Here, we report a case of a 78-year-old female patient with FT1D after DIHS treatment. She was diagnosed as DIHS caused by carbamazepine, and treatment with predonisolone was initiated. After 46 days from the occurrence of DIHS, she was admitted to our hospital because of type 1 diabetes mellitus and diabetic ketoacidosis. Although her Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was elevated by predonisolone treatment (HbA1c: 9.2%), we diagnosed her as fulminant type 1 diabetes mellitus considering the abrupt onset of the ketoacidosis. Her general condition was improved by treatment with fluid infusion and insulin administration. During her clinical course, the infection of coxsackie B4 virus was observed. In addition, the examination of HLA typing showed HLA-A24 haplotype. These findings suggest that the coxsackie B4 virus infection may be involved in the pathogenesis of DIHS-induced FT1D, and that HLA-A24 haplotype might relate to DIHS-associated FT1D.']"

APS3 is rare, and its pathogenesis is unclear. We describe a female patient with APS3 whose human leukocyte antigen (HLA) type could provide a clue to the pathogenesis of APS3. CASE REPORT A 40-year-old Japanese female patient who had been diagnosed with MG at 5 years of age, and which had been treated with cholinesterase inhibitors, was referred to our hospital with thirst, polydipsia, polyuria, weight loss, and hyperglycemia. She was found to have type 1 diabetes mellitus based on laboratory tests. She was also positive for anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody and was thus diagnosed with Hashimoto disease. This combination of type 1 diabetes mellitus, myasthenia gravis, and Hashimoto disease led to a diagnosis of APS3. Her HLA serotype was A24; B46/54; DR4/9; DQ8/9, and genotype was A*24: 02; B*46: 01: 01/54: 01: 01; C*01: 02; DRB1*04: 06/09: 01: 02; DQB1*03: 02: 01/03: 03: 02; and DQA1*03: 01/03: 02: 01. We subsequently reviewed 10 cases of APS3 combined with MG, including the present case and cases reported in Japanese. This review revealed that HLA-DR9/DQ9 might be a specific HLA subtype associated with APS3 with MG. Four of the 10 cases had MG diagnosed before diabetes mellitus and autoimmune thyroid disease. CONCLUSIONS The present case showed that, in people with HLA-B46 and -DR9, antibody-negative MG can precede the development of APS3 by many years. Physicians should consider the possibility of APS3 when evaluating patients with ocular-type myasthenia gravis, and screen them for type 1 diabetes.']"

Zinc transporter\xa08 (ZnT8), a novel islet autoantigen, is specifically expressed in insulin-containing secretory granules of β-cells. Genetic studies show that the genotypes of SLC30A8 can determine either protective or diabetogenic response depending on environmental and lifestyle factors. The ZnT8 protein expression, as well as zinc content in β-cells, was decreased in diabetic mice. Thus, ZnT8 might participate in insulin biosynthesis and release, and subsequently involved deteriorated β-cell function through direct or indirect mechanisms in type\xa01 diabetes mellitus and type\xa02 diabetes mellitus. From a clinical feature standpoint, the prevalence of ZnT8A is gradiently increased in type\xa02 diabetes mellitus, latent autoimmune diabetes in adults and type\xa01 diabetes mellitus. The frequency and epitopes of ZnT8-specific T\xa0cells and cytokine release by ZnT8-specific T\xa0cells are also different in diabetic patients and healthy controls. Additionally, the response to ZnT8 administration is also different in type\xa01 diabetes mellitus and type\xa02 diabetes mellitus.

Mitochondria, as autochthonous environmental bacteria living in our cells, and other bacteria share many common enzymes including beta-lactamases and it is supported by evidence that some beta-lactamase inhibitors are able to interact with counterpart enzymes. Thus, antibiotics may utilize two different pathways influencing the development of T1DM; one through modulation of microbiome and a second one via the interaction of mitochondrial enzymes. Data of consumption of penicillin (both narrow and broad spectrum) and beta-lactamase inhibitors in 30 European countries were collected from the database of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. These data were correlated with the prevalence reported by the International Diabetes Federation (2019) referring to type 1 diabetes in Europe.

Herein, the short- and long-term effects of a single injection of pregabalin on the acquisition of a fear extinction memory and parameters of anxiety in induced-T1DM animals were investigated. For that, we used the contextual fear conditioning (CFC) and elevated plus maze paradigms, respectively. A putative antioxidant activity was also evaluated. Our findings demonstrated that induced-T1DM animals presented greater expression of fear memory, difficulty in extinguishing this fear memory, associated with a more pronounced anxiety-like response. Pregabalin was able to induce a short and long-lasting effect by facilitating the acquisition of the fear extinction memory and inducing a later anxiolytic-like effect. Also, the increased lipid peroxidation levels in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of induced-T1DM rats were reduced after pregabalin injection, while the decreased levels of reduced glutathione were increased in the hippocampus. Despite the need for more studies to understand the mechanism of action of pregabalin under these conditions, our data demonstrate for the first time that a single injection of pregabalin in a specific time window was able to improve behavioral parameters in addition to inducing neuroprotective effect.

Here, we report the case of a 16-year-old adolescent with late-onset of FOXP3 R347H mutation associated IPEX syndrome with T1D, where insulin dependency was ameliorated following HSCT. This patient with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus required insulin dosage of 1.28\u2009U/kg/day for 1\u2009month before HSCT. Although the results of glucose homeostasis before HSCT revealed impaired insulin secretion and low ΔC-peptide immunoreactivity (CPR, 1.0 ng/mL), the patient withdrew insulin infusion and remained euglycemic at 15 months after HSCT, and had normal β-cell function with improved ΔCPR (3.4 ng/mL) at 20 months after HSCT. The present case suggests that HSCT for T1D-associated IPEX syndrome improves Treg deficiency and prevents elimination of β-cells. We speculate that the period from the onset of T1D to HSCT could affect the therapeutic efficacy for T1D with IPEX, and early intervention with HSCT before or immediately after the onset of DM can rescue β-cells and remit T1D completely.

These disorders are characterized by the presence of antibodies against tissue transglutaminase, thyroglobulin, and thyroid peroxidase (TPO), as well as against gastric parietal cells. Cross-sectional studies have reported that the risk of autoimmune thyroid diseases in patients with type-1 DM is two- to threefold higher than in the general population.

Furthermore, there is a lot of controversy regarding the role of thyroid autoimmunity in the pathogenesis of thyroid cancer. Here, a type-1 DM patient diagnosed with papillary thyroid cancer is presented. Case Report: Herein, it was aimed to present a 20-year-old female patient diagnosed with type-1 DM and subsequently with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC).

The most important and interesting point in this case is that, if we did not check her thyroid-associated antibodies, we could not have diagnosed her as APS. From the data of this case, we assumed that the patient suffered from APS type 3A, 3B, and 3D variants. This case pointed out very clearly the importance of testing for thyroid-associated antibodies under various autoimmune disease conditions even if the thyroid hormone levels are euthyroid.

The glutamate transporter solute carrier family 1, member 2 (GLT1/EAAT2) is expressed on the membrane of pancreatic β-cells and physiologically controls extracellular glutamate concentrations thus preventing glutamate-induced β-cell death. We hypothesized that GLT1 could be an immunological target in T1DM and that autoantibodies against GLT1 could be pathogenic. Immunoprecipitation and ELISA experiments showed that sera from T1DM subjects recognized GLT1 expressed in brain, pancreatic islets, and GLT1-transfected COS7-cell extracts. We validated these findings in two cohorts of T1DM patients by quantitative immunofluorescence assays. Analysis of the combined data sets indicated the presence of autoantibodies against GLT1 in 32 of the 87 (37%) T1DM subjects and in none of healthy controls (n\xa0=\xa064) (p\xa0<\xa00.0001). Exposure of pancreatic βTC3 cells and human islets to purified IgGs from anti-GLT1 positive sera supplemented with complement resulted in plasma membrane ruffling, cell lysis and death. The cytotoxic effect was prevented when sera were depleted from IgGs. Furthermore, in the absence of complement, 6 out of 16 (37%) anti-GLT1 positive sera markedly reduced GLT1 transport activity in βTC3 cells by inducing GLT1 internalization, also resulting in β-cell death. In conclusion, we provide evidence that GLT1 is a novel T1DM autoantigen and that anti-GLT1 autoantibodies cause β-cell death through complement-dependent and independent mechanisms. GLT1 seems an attractive novel therapeutic target for the prevention of β-cell death in individuals with diabetes and prediabetes.']"

However, there are few studies of the prognostic and therapeutic values of the systemic autoimmune response in this pathology after transplant of autologous mesenchymal stem cells. Here, we present a 40-year-old patient with complications of type 1 diabetes mellitus (diabetic retinopathy) after mesenchymal stem cell transplant. Based on peripheral blood results, we were able to calculate integral hematologic parameters, allowing us to indirectly assess the patient's immune system after autologous mesenchymal stem cell transplant. One month after autologous mesenchymal stem cell transplant, we observed a positive immune response, with a 40% decrease in leukocyte intoxication index and a 22% increase from the initial lymphocyte and eosinophil ratio index values, which indicated the formation of a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction. Two months after transplant, stem cell leukocyte intoxication index, in contrast, increased by 10%, indicating a possible metabolic shift. At the same time, changes were observed in the lymphocyte stimulation index value, which increased by 11%. This observation indicated negative immunologic reactivity, namely, poor function of factors of nonspecific resistance due to autointoxication of the organism. However, 3 months after transplant, the hematologic parameters of this patient returned to levels before treatment. The use of integral hematologic parameters can indirectly interpret parallels between immunologic reactivity and metabolic disorders in type 1 diabetes mellitus complications (diabetic retinopathy) after autologous mesenchymal stem cell transplant.

What had been a death sentence became a manageable, albeit chronic, disease. Insulin did not cure the disease, as it did not address the actual disease process, but instead treated its sequelae, namely elevated blood sugars. Importantly, insulin administration fails to ensure normoglycaemia. Even with the most sophisticated 'near closed-loop' methods, glucose homeostasis is not restored to normal. T1DM patients face complications, both short-term, such as hypo- and hyperglycaemia, and long-term, with increased glycosylation of proteins leading to eye, kidney, nervous system and other sequelae. These complications are associated with significant morbidity and mortality even after intensive insulin treatment. Nearly 100 years after the discovery of insulin, we continue to face the challenge of addressing the disease process itself, in order to fundamentally improve the life of these patients.

The aim of this overview is to investigate the effect of T1DM on all-cause mortality and CVD morbidity and mortality. During the last decades, the treatment of T1DM has improved the prognosis of the patients. Still, the mortality rates are higher than those of the age- and sex-matched general population. With the prolonged survival, the macrovascular complications and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) appear as major health problems in the management of patients with T1DM. The studies on the CVD morbidity and mortality in this disease group are sparse, but they reveal that T1DM is associated with at least 30% higher mortality. In comparison to healthy people, CVDs are more common in T1DM patients and they occur earlier in life. Furthermore, they are a major cause for death and impaired quality of life in T1DM patients. The correlation between diabetic control and the duration of T1DM is not always present or is insignificant. Nevertheless, the early detection of the preclinical stages of the diseases and the risk factors for their development is important; similarly, the efforts to improve glycemic and metabolic control are of paramount importance.']"

Based on this, the enzymes have been studied in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) and plasma of young people with T1DM.<b>Methods:</b> Patients were recruited from Muratsan University Hospital (Yerevan, Armenia) and were divided into groups: girls and boys by age, from children to adolescents and adolescents/young adults with recent-onset T1DM (RO-T1DM) (0.1-1\xa0years) and long-term T1DM (LT-T1DM) (1.6-9.9\xa0years). Arginase activity was assessed by L-arginine-dependent production of L-ornithine, and the NOS activity was assessed by NO/nitrite production. Glycemic control was assessed using hemoglobin A1c test. Plasma HbA1c concentration below 7.5% (median (range) 6.7 [6.2-7.5]) was taken as good glycemic control (+) and above 7.5% (median (range) 10.5 [7.6-13]) as poor glycemic control (-). Healthy volunteers with corresponding sex and age were used as the control group.<b>Results:</b> All the patients with RO-T1DM, with poor glycemic control, had increased arginase activity in the cytoplasm (cARG) and mitochondria (mARG) in PBL. In girls with RO-T1DM, with good glycemic control, the subcellular arginase activity decreased, and normalized in LT-T1DM, regardless of age. In contrast, boys from both age groups showed high arginase activity, regardless of glycemic control and duration of T1DM along with insulin therapy. At the same time, a significant decrease in the subcellular production of bioavailable NO was observed in children/preadolescents, regardless of glycemic control and duration of diabetes. In adolescents/young adult boys with RO-T1DM, with (-), the subcellular production of NO decreased significantly, and with LT-T1DM, the decrease was attenuated, but even with (+) remained lower than in healthy people. In contrast, in the group of same age girls with RO-T1DM, NO production increased above normal in both cellular compartments, while with LT-T1DM it normalized in the cytoplasm. In adolescents/young adults with LT-T1DM, NO production in PBL mitochondria decreased by almost a half, regardless of glycemic control and gender. Changes in the metabolic pathways of L-arginine in plasma differed and were less substantial than in the PBL cellular compartments in T1DM.<b>Conclusions:</b> Glycemic status and duration of T1DM along with insulin therapy affect the activity of arginase and NOS-dependent production of bioavailable NO in the cytoplasm and mitochondria in PBL of young patients with T1DM, depending on sex and age. Arginase and NOS can directly affect the processes occurring in the pancreas and the outcome of therapy through infiltrated leukocytes. Obtained data can be useful for understanding the heterogeneity of T1DM and using it to develop available criteria for assessing the severity and treatment of autoimmune diabetes.']"

In this study, it was aimed to find out whether chronic diseases are an effective factor or not in the cigarette smoking initiation of adolescents. One-hundred adolescents with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) and 50 adolescents with Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) aged 12 and above under follow-up at the Pediatric Endocrinology Clinic and 100 healthy adolescents within the same age group who applied to the Adolescent Outpatient Clinic were included in the study. A survey was applied to all of these adolescents, which had been developed by researchers and contained questions about their socio-demographic features and cigarette smoking. Fourteen (5.6%) of the 250 adolescents were smokers. The rate of those who tried, but quitted cigarette smoking was found as approximately 20%. Cigarette smoking rate of those with T1DM was 1%, of those with CAH was 4%, and of the healthy adolescents was 11%. Cigarette smoking was significantly lower in those with a chronic disease (2%) than those who were healthy (11%). Adolescents` parents and friends had an effect on the cigarette smoking initiation, and adolescents smoked their first cigarette generally because of curiosity. It was seen in this study that the adolescents with a chronic disease less frequently smoked cigarettes than the healthy adolescents, the rate of cigarette smoking in parents of cigarette smoking adolescents was very high, and their parents and friends had an effect on cigarette smoking initiation of adolescents.']"

Fish oil (FO), composed mostly of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), has been pointed out as quite promising for the treatment of depression given its neuroprotective property. Although DHA and EPA exert several physiological actions, DHA is known to play a critical role in postnatal brain development. This study aimed to investigate the effect of preventive treatment with FO (with more DHA in the composition) alone or associated with antidepressant drugs on depression-like behaviors and brain monoamines levels of juvenile induced-T1DM rats. Thus, prepubescent rats were submitted to a prolonged treatment with vehicle (VEH) or FO (50% of DHA and 20% EPA) starting 4\xa0weeks before the induction of experimental T1DM (on day 28) by streptozotocin. When combined, the treatment with vehicle, fluoxetine (FLX, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) or imipramine (IMI, a tricyclic antidepressant) started at week 6 (day 42) and lasted for 2\xa0weeks (until day 56). The behavioral tests were conducted on days 55 and 56, followed by hippocampal and prefrontal cortex dissection for neurochemical analyses. Our results showed that induced-T1DM rats pretreated with FO showed a significant increase of EPA and DHA in plasma, indicative of an increase in the systemic availability of these acids. As previously observed, induced-T1DM rats presented increased immobility and decreased swimming and climbing frequencies in the modified forced swimming test, indicative of depressive-like behavior. Only the combined treatment - FO plus antidepressants (FLX or IMI - both in the highest dose) - was able to induce a significant improvement of depressive-like behaviors. Here, it is noteworthy that swimming behavior has been associated with an increase in serotonergic neurotransmission. Interestingly, our data showed that the combined treatment (FO\xa0+\xa0antidepressants - including the ineffective dose of FLX) was able to increase the swimming of animals more significantly compared to animals not pretreated with FO. In addition, confirming these assumptions, the decreased 5-HT levels in the hippocampus from induced-T1DM rats were increased after treatment with FLX (highest dose) or IMI (both doses), being this increase more pronounced in animal pretreated with FO. Intriguingly, in these animals pretreated with FO, the ineffective dose of FLX in association with FO was able to increase the levels of 5-HT. The decreased hippocampal levels of noradrenaline were increased only after IMI treatment, not being influenced by FO pretreatment. In conclusion, ours results pointed out that the choice of the DHA/EPA ratio may be an important factor to be considered for the FO antidepressant-like effectper se,but the FO treatment in this composition associated with the antidepressant drugs - especially that ones that increase preferentially the availability of 5-HT -, may represent a better alternative of treatment to individuals with T1DM-associated depression.']"

Enhanced platelet reactivity is considered a main determinant of the increased atherothrombotic risk of diabetic patients. Thrombopoietin (THPO), a humoral growth factor able to stimulate megakaryocyte proliferation and differentiation, also modulates the response of mature platelets by enhancing both activation and binding to leukocytes in response to different agonists. Increased THPO levels have been reported in different clinical conditions characterized by a generalized pro-thrombotic state, from acute coronary syndromes to sepsis/septic shock, and associated with elevated indices of platelet activation. To investigate the potential contribution of elevated THPO levels in platelet activation in T1DM patients, we studied 28 T1DM patients and 28 healthy subjects. We measured plasma levels of THPO, as well as platelet-leukocyte binding, P-selectin, and THPO receptor (THPOR) platelet expression. The priming activity of plasma from diabetic patients or healthy subjects on platelet-leukocyte binding and the role of THPO on this effect was also studied in vitro. T1DM patients had higher circulating THPO levels and increased platelet-monocyte and platelet-granulocyte binding, as well as platelet P-selectin expression, compared to healthy subjects, whereas platelet expression of THPOR did not differ between the two groups. THPO concentrations correlated with platelet-leukocyte binding, as well as with fasting glucose and Hb1Ac. In vitro, plasma from diabetic patients, but not from healthy subjects, primed platelet-leukocyte binding and platelet P-selectin expression. Blocking THPO biological activity using a specific inhibitor prevented the priming effect induced by plasma from diabetic patients. In conclusion, augmented THPO may enhance platelet activation in patients with T1DM, potentially participating in increasing atherosclerotic risk.']"

Glucocorticoid deficiency is a life-threatening condition, and patients who develop this deficiency require prompt diagnosis and treatment. However, a delayed diagnosis of hypopituitarism may occur due to its non-specific clinical manifestations. A common presenting sign of glucocorticoid deficiency is hypoglycemia. The amelioration of hyperglycemia has been observed in diabetic patients with adrenal insufficiency. We report the case of a 70-year-old Japanese woman who had suffered from fatigue and anorexia for several months; she was admitted based on refractory hyponatremia (sodium 125-128 mEq/L) and hypoglycemia (glucose 58-75 mg/dL).

Undetectable C-peptide levels and positive results of both insulinoma-associated antigen-2 antibodies and insulin autoantibodies indicated that she had experienced a recent onset of type 1 diabetes. The pathophysiological process indicated that overt hyperglycemia could be masked by the deficient action of glucocorticoids even in a diabetic patient with endogenous insulin deficiency.

Indian diets are predominantly carbohydrate-based with high glycemic index (GI) and low protein content. Various methods are available to increase the protein and fiber content and reduce the GI of food in order to limit glycemic excursions. Insulin regimens need to be tailored to the child's school timings, meal schedule, and the availability of a responsible adult to supervise/administer insulin. All patients, irrespective of economic and education background, should be taught the broad principles of healthy eating, balanced diet and carbohydrate counting.

Thus, β-cell protection may be a primary target in the treatment of T1DM. Evidence has demonstrated that defective mitochondrial function plays an important role in pancreatic β-cell dysfunction and apoptosis; however, the fundamental effect of mitochondrial complex I action on β-cells and T1DM remains unclear. In the current study, the pancreas protective effect of complex I inhibitor rotenone (ROT) and its potential mechanism were assessed in a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced mouse model of T1DM and in cultured mouse pancreatic β-cell line, Min6. ROT treatment exerted a hypoglycemic effect, restored the insulin level, and decreased inflammation and cell apoptosis in the pancreas. In vitro experiments also showed that ROT decreased STZ- and inflammatory cytokines-induced β-cell apoptosis. These protective effects were accompanied by attenuation of reactive oxygen species, increased mitochondrial membrane potential, and upregulation of transcriptional coactivator PPARα coactivator 1α (PGC-1α)-controlled mitochondrial biogenesis.

The selected markers of endothelial lesions (sVCAM-1, sICAM-1, sE-SELECTIN, PAI-1, ADMA and RAGE) were assayed by the immunoenzymatic ELISA method. The study involved 66 patients (age: 5-18 years) with type 1 diabetes and 21 healthy controls (age: 5-16 years). In the type 1 diabetes patients, significantly higher concentrations of all of the assayed markers were observed compared to the healthy controls (<i>p</i> < 0.001). All of the evaluated markers positively correlated with the disease duration, the age, and BMI of the patients, while only PAI-1 and sE-SELECTIN were characteristic of linear correlations with the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). It can be concluded that endothelial inflammatory disease occurs in the early stages of type 1 diabetes mellitus in children.

This increase in CP indicates the possibility of pancreatic beta cell regeneration and/or increased function. The commonly accepted belief that individuals with T1DM quickly lose all function of pancreatic beta cells has led to academic consequences; many immunotherapy clinical trials' inclusion criteria require participants to have a new diagnosis of T1DM based on the assumption that those with a longer duration of diabetes have unrecoverable cessation of insulin secretion. CP could influence inflammation, microvascular circulation, and endothelial function. Further, it could affect the neuronal and glomerular structure and/or function. These potential functions of CP are seen by the correlation between measurable CP levels and decreased diabetic complication rates.""]"

Objectives We aim to determine the prevalence of associated autoimmune diseases (Hashimoto's thyroiditis, celiac disease (CD), and adrenal insufficiency (AI)) and evaluate the most reporting symptoms and glycemic control assessment, as well as microvascular complications and hypoglycemia episodes. Methods A cross-sectional study of 251 patients with T1DM at the diabetic clinic of King Abdulaziz Medical City in Riyadh (KAMC-RD), Saudi Arabia, was conducted. Autoimmune serologies including thyroid peroxidase (TPO)\xa0antibody and tissue transglutaminase IgA (tTG-IgA) antibody were checked with hormonal studies such as thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), morning serum cortisol, and short Synacthen test (SST) with duodenal biopsy results all were reviewed if present. Patients were directly interviewed to evaluate for the most common symptoms (including hypoglycemia episodes) for the preceding two weeks. Glycemic control was assessed by measuring glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). Microvascular complications (i.e., nephropathy and retinopathy) were estimated by looking at the urine albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) besides the ophthalmology's visit notes. Results The mean age was 26.3 ± 7.7 years, and the mean duration of diabetes at the time of data collection was 12.2 ± 7.6 years, whereas the mean HbA1c was 8.9% ± 1.8%. The prevalence of hypothyroidism was 16.3%, and TPO positivity was discovered in 58.6% of the tested patients (n = 70) with equal prevalence among both genders (p = 0.685). tTG-IgA were noticed among 16.4% of the patients (n = 164) without significant difference among gender. Serum cortisol test was performed among 128 patients; 28.1% had suboptimal levels, and 5.5% were deficient. Only four patients (n = 15) had suboptimal responses after SST. Nervousness and anxiety (p < 0.001), fatigue with weakness (p = 0.018), weight gain (p = 0.017), and cold intolerance (p = 0.005) were noted, which were statistically significantly higher among females. Weight gain was statistically significantly higher among the age group of >30 years (p = 0.036). For microvascular complication\xa0screening, ACR was collected in 199 (79.2%) participants, with a mean of 27.7 ± 155.9 mg/mmol. Only 10 (5%) patients had microalbuminuria, and 16 (8%) had macroalbuminuria; it was correlated significantly with diabetes duration (p = 0.045). A total of 132 (52.8%) patients were seen by ophthalmology, 28 (21.4%) had nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR), and 10 (7.6%) has proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) that significantly correlated with the duration of diabetes (p = 0.027). During patient\xa0interviews, 187 (74.5%) reported symptomatic hypoglycemia events that correlated significantly with glycemic control (p = 0.029). Conclusion Autoimmunity in Saudi adults with type 1\xa0diabetes mellitus was significant with equal prevalence among both genders and age groups with no or slight difference. Clinical manifestations of autoimmunity were higher in women. Diabetes\xa0chronicity and poor glycemic control were the major\xa0complications; therefore, early glycemic control is advocated. Regular screening for autoimmunity and its complications is recommended for type 1 diabetic patients. Autoimmunity was found almost similar to previous literature.""]"

Focus of the review is on the role of innate immune system, including activation of some signaling cascades, cytokine response, and activity of the Toll-like receptors in the development of T1D. Dysfunction of innate immunity is the cause of the attack of pancreatic beta cells by the host T-lymphocytes, which leads to the death of pancreatic beta cells that produce insulin. Lack of insulin causes hyperglycemia and the need for lifelong injections of insulin in patients with T1D, which, nevertheless, does not exclude damage to many organs and tissues, given particular vulnerability of the blood vessels under conditions of hyperglycemia. The review discusses the role of oxidative stress as a factor that plays a major role in damage of vascular system and pancreatic tissue during the development of T1D. Considering high sensitivity of pancreatic beta cells to the action of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the possibility of using antioxidants for reducing the level of pathological consequences in the course of T1D development is discussed. New information on anti-diabetic activity of the exogenous antioxidant enzyme peroxiredoxin 6, which is capable of penetrating cells, activating insulin production in beta cells, reducing ROS levels, as well as decreasing activation of some signaling cascades, production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and expression of Toll-like receptors in beta cells and in immune cells during T1D development is discussed.']"

Here we studied whether (i) prolonged minocycline treatment suppresses pain behaviour in PDN, (ii) the minocycline effect varies with submodality of pain, and (iii) the suppression of pain behaviour by prolonged minocycline treatment is associated with antidepressive-like effect. The experiments were performed in streptozotocin-induced rat model of type-1 diabetes. Pain behaviour was evoked by innocuous (monofilaments) and noxious (paw pressure) mechanical stimulation, innocuous cold (acetone drops) and noxious heat (radiant heat). Depression-like behaviour was assessed using forced swimming test. Minocycline treatment (daily 80mg/kg per os) of three-week duration started four weeks after induction of diabetes. Diabetes induced mechanical allodynia and hyperalgesia, cold allodynia, heat hypoalgesia, and depression-like behaviour. Minocycline treatment significantly attenuated mechanical allodynia and depression-like behaviour, while it failed to produce significant changes in mechanical hyperalgesia, cold allodynia or heat hypoalgesia.

In the present study, we obtained a differential circRNA expression profile based on microarray analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in children with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). We characterized one differentially expressed circRNA back-spliced from the MYB Proto-Oncogene Like 2 (<i>MYBL2</i>) gene in patients with T1DM, termed as <i>hsa_circ_0060450</i>. Subsequent assays revealed that <i>hsa_circ_0060450</i> can serve as the sponge of miR-199a-5p, release its target gene, Src homology 2 (SH2)-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP2), encoded by the tyrosine-protein phosphatase non-receptor type 11 gene (<i>PTPN11</i>), and further suppress the JAK-STAT signaling pathway triggered by type I interferon (IFN-I) to inhibit macrophage-mediated inflammation, which indicates the important roles of circRNAs in T1DM and represents a promising therapeutic molecule in the treatment of T1DM.""]"

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of stem cells transplantation (SCT) in patients with T1DM. We searched five literature databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, WanFang and CENTRAL) up to 31 October 2019. 29 studies (487 patients with T1DM) were included in our meta-analysis. There was no substantial publication bias. Meta-analysis showed the SCT had significant effect to decrease HbA1c (SMD, 1.40; 95% CI, 0.93 to 1.86; p < 0.00001; I<sup>2</sup> = 89%) and to improve C-peptide levels (SMD, -0.62; 95% CI, -1.22 to -0.02; p = 0.04; I<sup>2</sup> = 92%) at 1 year follow-up. Subgroup analyses showed the heterogeneity level of the results was high. Significant improvement of metabolic outcomes was observed in the subgroups of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) combined with hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and HSCs. The older age showed significant association with the efficacy in HSCs subgroup. The higher GADA positive rate before treatment also significantly associated with the decrease of daily insulin requirement. The transient insulin independence rate at last follow-up was 9.6 per 100 person-years (95% CI: 5.8-13.5%). The mean length of insulin independence was 15.6 months (95% CI: 12.3-18.9). The mortality of SCT was 3.4% (95% CI: 2.1-5.5%). Therefore, SCT is an efficacious and safe method for treating patients with T1DM especially in the subgroups of MSCs + HSCs and HSCs. Well designed, double blind and randomized controlled trails with large sample size and long-term follow-up are needed for further evaluation.']"

Subsequently, segmented inner retinal layers were analyzed using VA. Deviation maps were generated to readily visualize thickness differences between both groups and to investigate thickness changes of individual patients in relation to the control group. <b>Results</b>: In DevMs of the patient group, the total retina (TR) demonstrated localized, irregular areas of thinning (mean ± standard deviation) involving foveal center, inner macula, and inferior-nasal outer macula (-9.31 ± 1.73 µm; p < 0.05). Similarly, retinal nerve fiber layer showed continuous and localized areas of thinning in both inner and outer macula, extending nasally (-5.45 ± 4.31 µm; p < 0.05). In DevMs of individual patients, the TR and inner retinal layers revealed remarkable changes in thickness that were present between patients at both late and early stages of diabetes. <b>Conclusion</b>: The VA method simplifies the in-depth analysis of OCT volume data from different groups and is effective in detecting retinal thickness changes in children with diabetes. It can be easily adopted in a clinical set-up and intuitively used in complex multidisciplinary studies.']"

Our results suggest that bone formation in T1DM patients is impaired by reduction of endogenous BMP6, and supplementation of BMP6 enhances osteogenesis of BMSCs to restore BMD in a mouse model of T1DM, which provides insight into the development of clinical treatments for T1DM-assocaited bone loss.

Low hemoglobin A1c levels in a patient with diabetic ketoacidosis: Fulminant type 1 diabetes mellitus. Turk J Pediatr 2018; 60: 201-205. Fulminant type 1 diabetes mellitus (FT1DM) is a clinical condition that is characterized by remarkably rapid and complete pancreatic β-cell destruction, rapid onset of hyperglycemic symptoms followed by ketoacidosis. In most cases this process takes a few days. Although rare, there have been clinical manifestations with a prolonged progress that lasts longer than one week. This study focused on the case of a 35-monthold boy who was referred to our clinic with the diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis, and later had a modest elevation in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels (6.7 %) incompatible with his significantly elevated blood glucose levels. The autoantibodies against pancreatic β-cells were negative. On the basis of these above mentioned findings, our patient was then diagnosed with fulminant type 1 diabetes mellitus. If patients with diabetic ketoacidosis have no elevation in HbA1c levels, they should be assessed for possible clinical factors that can lead to lower detectable levels of HbA1c. Furthermore, FT1DM which is characterized by very rapid and potentially fatal progression should be considered as a differential diagnosis in these patients.']"
