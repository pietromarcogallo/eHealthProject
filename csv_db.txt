Hypertension was induced with 40 mg/kg body weight (b.w.) of N omega-nitro-L-arginine-methyl (L-NAME) administered orally. Dyslipidemia was induced by the administration of a diet with a high cholesterol (2%) content. Diabetes mellitus was induced by intraperitoneal administration of a single dose of streptozocin (65 mg/kg). Malondialdehyde (MDA) and total oxidative status (TOS) are increased by all three cardiovascular risk factors (up to 207%). The indirect assessment of NO synthesis (NOx) is observed to be reduced after L-NAME administration (43%), and dyslipidemia induction (16%), while type 1 diabetes mellitus is associated with the highest levels of NOx (increased 112%). Hypertension, dyslipidemia, and type 1 diabetes reduced the total antioxidative capacity (TAC) and total thiol (SH) levels (up to 57%). The values of evaluated pro-inflammatory cytokines, tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-1β (IL-1β), assessed from the ascending aorta were elevated by all three cardiovascular risk factors, with the highest levels induced by type 1 diabetes mellitus (up to 259%). The histopathological examination of the ascending and descending aorta revealed reversible pro-atherogenic changes consisting of the accumulation of lipid droplets in the subendothelial connective tissue on rats with hypertension and dyslipidemia. Irreversible pro-atherogenic changes consisting of a reduction of the specific elasticity of the arteries were observed in rats with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Type 1 diabetes mellitus demonstrates an alteration of the oxidative stress parameters, the elevation of tissue levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines and causing irreversible pro-atherogenic changes on the aortic wall."

Lithium, a first-line therapy for bipolar disorder, has become an attractive agent for attenuating peripheral neuropathy and menopause-induced bone loss. Therefore, our aim was to determine the effect of chronic lithium treatment on mechanical hypersensitivity and trabecular bone loss induced by T1DM in mice. T1DM was induced in male C57BL/6J mice by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ, 50 mg/kg/day, for 5 consecutive days). 12 weeks after T1DM-induction, mice received a daily intraperitoneal injection of vehicle, 30 or 60 mg/kg lithium (as LiCl) for 6 weeks. Throughout the treatment period, blood glucose levels and mechanical sensitivity were evaluated every 2 weeks. After lithium treatment, the femur and L5 vertebra were harvested for microcomputed tomography (microCT) analysis. T1DM mice showed significant hyperglycemia, mechanical hypersensitivity, and significant trabecular bone loss as compared with the control group. Chronic lithium treatment did not revert the hindpaw mechanical hypersensitivity nor hyperglycemia associated to T1DM induced by STZ. In contrast, microCT analysis revealed that lithium reverted, in a dose-dependent manner, the loss of trabecular bone associated to T1DM induced by STZ at both the distal femur and L5 vertebra. Lithium treatment by itself did not affect any trabecular bone parameter in non-diabetic mice."

While current knowledge regarding the molecules related to the pathogenesis and diagnosis of T1DM is vast, the discovery of new molecules, such as micro ribonucleic acids (micro-RNAs, miRNAs), as well as their interactions with T1DM, has spurred novel prospects in the diagnosis of the disease. This review aims at summarizing current knowledge regarding miRNAs' biosynthesis and action pathways and their role as gene expression regulators in T1DM. MiRNAs follow a complex biosynthesis pathway, including cleaving and transport from nucleus to cytoplasm. After assembly of their final form, they inhibit translation or cause messenger RNA (mRNA) degradation, resulting in the obstruction of protein synthesis. Many studies have reported miRNA involvement in T1DM pathogenesis, mainly through interference with pancreatic b-cell function, insulin production and secretion. They are also found to contribute to β-cell destruction, as they aid in the production of autoreactive agents. Due to their elevated accumulation in various biological specimens, as well as their involvement in T1DM pathogenesis, their role as biomarkers in early preclinical T1DM diagnosis is widely hypothesized, with future studies concerning their diagnostic value deemed a necessity."

We investigated associations between cfPWV and renal outcomes, cardiovascular events, and all-cause mortality in people with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Methods and Results cfPWV was measured with SphygmoCor in 633 people with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Median (interquartile range) follow-up was 6.2 (5.8-6.7) years. End points included progression in albuminuria group, decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥30%, end-stage kidney disease, cardiovascular event, mortality, and a composite renal end point. Hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated per 1-SD increase in cfPWV. Adjustments included age, sex, hemoglobin A1c, mean arterial pressure, body mass index, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking, urine albumin excretion rate, and eGFR. The cohort included 45% women, mean (SD) age was 54 (13) years, mean (SD) eGFR was 83.2 (27.9) mL/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, and mean (SD) cfPWV was 10.4 (3.3) m/s. Median (interquartile range) albumin excretion rate was 17 (17-63) mg/24 h. After adjustment, higher cfPWV was associated with increased hazard of progression in albuminuria (HR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.10-2.32); decline in eGFR ≥30% (HR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.06-1.79); cardiovascular event (HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.01-1.70); mortality (HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.00-1.85); and the composite renal end point (HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.04-1.63), but not with end-stage kidney disease (HR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.62-2.26). Higher cfPWV was associated with steeper yearly increase in albumin excretion and steeper yearly decline in eGFR after adjustment (<i>P</i>=0.002 and <i>P</i>=0.01, respectively). Conclusions cfPWV was associated with increased hazard of renal outcomes, cardiovascular event, and mortality. cfPWV may be suited for risk stratification in type 1 diabetes mellitus."

It is known that one of the main manifestations of brain damage in type 1 diabetes is cognitive impairment, which is possibly associated with the peculiarities of vascularization and interhemispheric asymmetry, which requires in-depth analysis using modern neuroimaging methods. The aim of the study is to assess the symmetry of structural, metabolic and neurovascularization changes in the brain in patients with type 1 diabetes and cognitive impairment. The study included 120 patients with type 1 diabetes aged 18 to 45 years suffering from cognitive impairment, and 30 people without cognitive decline and the control group (n=30) healthy people without diabetes. Neuropsychological testing included the Montreal Cognitive Dysfunction Assessment Scale (MoCA test). For neuroimaging methods, standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), contrast and non-contrast-enhanced perfusion were used. Statistical processing was carried out using the SPSS Statistic 2020 software. In patients with type 1 diabetes with cognitive impairment, as manifested by impaired memory and/or attention, perfusion imaging revealed the presence of brain asymmetry zones. Standard MRI allowed to demonstrate changes in the white, gray matter and hippocampus in the right hemisphere. The results obtained were refined taking into account the topical localization, so during the perfusion study, regions with asymmetric blood flow were identified - namely, the white matter of the frontal lobe and the gray matter in the occipital lobe. Spectroscopy of the brain revealed that it was in these areas of the brain that the most significant metabolic disorders were noted - in the form of significantly altered ratio of N-acetylaspartate (NAA)/choline (Cho) on the left, along with the asymmetry in phosphocreatine level (Cr 2) on the right. In conclusion, early preclinical predictive diagnostics with the use of modern neuroimaging methods allows for timely detection of impaired vascularization and brain metabolism in this group of patients, However, decreased perfusion in the region within the region of frontal lobe white matter and temporal lobe grey matter, and hippocampal cell metabolism by spectra should be highlighted among the parameters Cr right and NAA/Cho left."

29504478,Targeting dysfunctional beta-cell signaling for the potential treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus.,['Diabetes'],"['Rachel J Fenske', 'Michelle E Kimple']","Since its discovery and purification by Frederick Banting in 1921, exogenous insulin has remained almost the sole therapy for type 1 diabetes mellitus. While insulin alleviates the primary dysfunction of the disease, many other aspects of the pathophysiology of type 1 diabetes mellitus are unaffected. Research aimed towards the discovery of novel type 1 diabetes mellitus therapeutics targeting different cell signaling pathways is gaining momentum. The focus of these efforts has been almost entirely on the impact of immunomodulatory drugs, particularly those that have already received FDA-approval for other autoimmune diseases. However, these drugs can often have severe side effects, while also putting already immunocompromised individuals at an increased risk for other infections. Potential therapeutic targets in the insulin-producing beta-cell have been largely ignored by the type 1 diabetes mellitus field, save the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor. While there is preliminary evidence to support the clinical exploration of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor-based drugs as type 1 diabetes mellitus adjuvant therapeutics, there is a vast space for other putative therapeutic targets to be explored. The alpha subunit of the heterotrimeric G<sub>z</sub> protein (Gα<sub>z</sub>) has been shown to promote beta-cell inflammation, dysfunction, death, and failure to replicate in the context of diabetes in a number of mouse models. Genetic loss of Gα<sub>z</sub> or inhibition of the Gα<sub>z</sub> signaling pathway through dietary interventions is protective against the development of insulitis and hyperglycemia. The multifaceted effects of Gα<sub>z</sub> in regards to beta-cell health in the context of diabetes make it an ideal therapeutic target for further study. It is our belief that a low-risk, effective therapy for type 1 diabetes mellitus will involve a multidimensional approach targeting a number of regulatory systems, not the least of which is the insulin-producing beta-cell. Impact statement The expanding investigation of beta-cell therapeutic targets for the treatment and prevention of type 1 diabetes mellitus is fundamentally relevant and timely. This review summarizes the overall scope of research into novel type 1 diabetes mellitus therapeutics, highlighting weaknesses or caveats in current clinical trials as well as describing potential new targets to pursue. More specifically, signaling proteins that act as modulators of beta-cell function, survival, and replication, as well as immune infiltration may need to be targeted to develop the most efficient pharmaceutical interventions for type 1 diabetes mellitus. One such beta-cell signaling pathway, mediated by the alpha subunit of the heterotrimeric G<sub>z</sub> protein (Gα<sub>z</sub>), is discussed in more detail. The work described here will be critical in moving the field forward as it emphasizes the central role of the beta-cell in type 1 diabetes mellitus disease pathology."

The objective of the present study was to explore other potential indications for ONO-4641 based on its immunomodulatory effects. ONO-4641 was tested in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, an animal model of spontaneous type 1 diabetes mellitus, an autoimmune disease with unmet medical needs. ONO-4641 at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg prevented the onset of diabetes mellitus in NOD mice. Furthermore, ONO-4641 at doses of 0.03 and 0.1 mg/kg decreased diabetic prevalence in NOD mice after the onset of diabetes mellitus in a dose-dependent manner. Histopathological analysis demonstrated that insulin-positive areas in the islets of mice administered 0.03 and 0.1 mg/kg ONO-4641 showed a tendency of high values although they were not significantly different from the Control group, which was treated with vehicle. These observations suggest ONO-4641 may delay the onset and progression of type 1 diabetes mellitus."

Recent scientific reports suggest that people with type 1 diabetes mellitus also develop insulin resistance, which is generally considered to be a distinctive feature of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The causes of insulin resistance in type 1 diabetes mellitus were explored, but there was a lack of publications that connected the risk factors of insulin resistance in type 1 diabetes mellitus with the proposition of repair mechanisms that are offered by quaternary prevention. Toward this end, the present review is an attempt to combine the previous reports on the causes of insulin resistance in type 1 diabetes mellitus and a brief review of quaternary prevention. The destructive effect of insulin resistance on many physiological processes that predisposes the individual to chronic diabetes complications creates an urgent need to introduce effective therapeutic methods for preventing the development and progression of this pathology."

Nivolumab, an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, blocks PD-1 and can restore anti-cancer immune responses by disrupting the signal that inhibits T-cell activation. Nivolumab may induce endocrine-related adverse events, including hypophysitis, autoimmune thyroiditis, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. Here we report a 68-year-old female patient with advanced renal cell carcinoma who was treated with nivolumab. She had positive anti-thyroglobulin antibodies and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies with slightly elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (9.048 μU/mL), and was diagnosed as chronic thyroiditis with subclinical hypothyroidism before nivolumab therapy. She developed painless thyroiditis after the first cycle of the therapy (Day 14). At the 7th cycle of nivolumab therapy (Day 98), hyperglycemia (473 mg/dL) was noted, whereas glycated hemoglobin level was 6.9%. Islet-related autoantibodies were all negative. The glucagon tolerance test showed complete depletion of insulin. Human leukocyte antigen typing showed haplotype DRB1*09:01-DQB1*03:03, which was reported to be closely associated with type 1 diabetes mellitus in Japan. Fulminant type 1 diabetes mellitus was diagnosed, and she was immediately treated with multiple daily injections of insulin. Fulminant type 1 diabetes mellitus is characterized by rapid-onset diabetic ketoacidosis, and negative islet-related autoantibodies, and was proposed as a novel subtype of non-autoimmune diabetes. Preceding painless thyroiditis with positive thyroid autoantibodies observed in the present case, however, raises the possibility that autoimmune mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of nivolumab-induced fulminant type 1 diabetes mellitus."

Hence, suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress may ameliorate or decrease the severity of diabetes mellitus. To investigate the effect and mechanism(s) of action of RVD1, an anti-inflammatory metabolite derived from docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), on STZ-induced type 1 DM in male Wistar rats, type 1 diabetes was induced by single intraperitoneal (i.p) streptozotocin (STZ-65 mg/kg) injection. RVD1 (60 ng/mL, given intraperitoneally) was administered from day 1 along with STZ for five consecutive days. Plasma glucose, IL-6, TNF-α, BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor that has anti-diabetic actions), LXA4 (lipoxin A4), and RVD1 levels and BDNF concentrations in the pancreas, liver, and brain tissues were measured. Apoptotic (<i>Bcl2/Bax</i>), inflammatory (<i>COX-1/COX-2/Nf-κb/iNOS/PPAR-γ</i>) genes and downstream insulin signaling proteins (Gsk-3β/Foxo1) were measured in the pancreatic tissue along with concentrations of various antioxidants and lipid peroxides. RVD1 decreased severity of STZ-induced type 1 DM by restoring altered plasma levels of TNF-α, IL-6, and BDNF (<i>p</i> < 0.001); expression of pancreatic <i>COX-1/COX-2/PPAR-γ</i> genes and downstream insulin signaling proteins (Gsk-3β/Foxo1) and the concentrations of antioxidants and lipid peroxides to near normal. RVD1 treatment restored expression of <i>Bcl2/Pdx</i> genes, plasma LXA4 (<i>p</i> < 0.001) and RVD1 levels and increased brain, pancreatic, intestine, and liver BDNF levels to near normal. The results of the present study suggest that RVD1 can prevent STZ-induced type 1 diabetes by its anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant actions and by activating the <i>Pdx</i> gene that is needed for pancreatic β cell proliferation."

Whether exposure to PAHs is associated with the incidence of type 1 diabetes mellitus should be investigated. To this end, pregnant mice were exposed to mixed PAHs (5, 50, or 500 μg/kg) once every other day during gestation. The adult male offspring displayed impaired glucose tolerance and reduced serum levels of glucagon and insulin. Immunohistochemical staining revealed increased numbers of apoptotic β-cells and a reduced β-cell mass in these males. The downregulated expression of pancreatic estrogen receptor α, androgen receptor, and transcription factor PDX1 was responsible for impacting β-cell development. The relatively reduced α-cell area was associated with downregulated ARX expression. The transcription of Isn2 and Gcg in pancreatic tissue was downregulated, which indicated that the function of β-cells and α-cells was impaired. Methylation levels in the Isn2 promotor were significantly elevated in mice prenatally exposed to 500 µg/kg PAHs, which was consistent with the change in its mRNA levels. The number of macrophages infiltrating islets was significantly increased, indicating that prenatal PAH exposure might reduce islet cell numbers in an autoimmune manner.

It is a significant global health problem as the incidence of this disorder is increasing worldwide. The causes are still poorly understood, although it certainly has genetic and environmental origins. Vitamin D formed profusely in the skin upon exposure to sunlight, as well as from dietary sources, exhibits an immunomodulatory effect based on gene transcription control. Indeed, vitamin D can downregulate mechanisms connected with adaptive immunity, induce immunological tolerance and decrease auto-aggression-related inflammation. These properties provide the basis for a preventive and therapeutic role of vitamin D. As many studies have demonstrated, appropriate supplementation with vitamin D reduces the risk of autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes mellitus, and alleviates disease symptoms in patients. The aim of this narrative review is to present the molecular mechanisms for the vitamin D immunomodulatory effect as well as review human clinical studies on the use of vitamin D as adjuvant therapy in type 1 diabetes mellitus."

Its most important immunologic markers are pancreatic beta-cell autoantibodies. This study aimed to determine diabetes mellitus antibodies frequency among children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes. Methods This descriptive study evaluated the frequency of four diabetes autoantibodies (glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 autoantibodies [GADA], islet cell autoantibodies [ICA], insulin autoantibodies [IAA], tyrosine phosphatase-like insulinoma antigen-2 antibodies [IA-2A]) and their serum level in children and adolescents diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus at the diabetes department of Bou-Ali-Sina Hospital and Baghban Clinic, Sari, Iran, from March 2012 to March 2018. The relationship between the level of different antibodies and age, gender, and diabetes duration were determined. A two-sided p value less than 0.05 indicated statistical significance. Results One hundred forty-two eligible patient records were screened. The average age at diabetes diagnosis was 4.2 ± 4.4 years. The median duration of diabetes was 34.0 (12.7-69.7) months. 53.5% of patients were female, and 81.7% of them had at least one positive autoantibody, and ICA in 66.2%, GADA in 56.3%, IA-2A in 40.1%, and IAA in 21.8% were positive. The type of the autoantibodies and their serum level was similar between females and males but there was a higher rate of positive autoantibodies in females. The level of IA-2A and ICA were in positive and weak correlation with age at diagnosis. Conclusions More than 80% of pediatric and adolescent patients with type 1 diabetes were autoantibody-positive. ICA and GADA were the most frequently detected autoantibodies. The presence of antibodies was significantly higher in females."

This study aims to explore the underlying molecular mechanism of resveratrol in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) through microRNA (miR)-129-containing extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) based on <i>in silico</i> analysis. The rat model of T1DM was established by intraperitoneal injection of sodium citrate containing streptozotocin, and the wound was made around the deep fascia. Rat MSCs were isolated and treated with resveratrol (SRT501), and the corresponding EVs (SRT501-EVs) were isolated, where the expression of miR-129 was determined. By performing function experiments, the effect of SRT501-EVs and miR-129 on the biological functions of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was determined. Finally, the binding relationship between miR-129 and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) was also determined by the dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. miR-129 was shown as a candidate related to both resveratrol and wound healing in T1DM. SRT501-EVs promoted the skin wound healing of T1DM rats and also further improved the proliferative, migratory, and tube formation potentials of HUVECs. Resveratrol inhibited the expression of TRAF6 in HUVECs stimulated by MSC-conditioned medium and promoted the transfer of miR-129 <i>via</i> EVs, while TRAF6 was confirmed as a target gene of miR-129. Furthermore, inhibition of miR-129 attenuated the proangiogenic effect of resveratrol on HUVECs. Resveratrol exerts promotive role in wound healing in T1DM through downregulation of TRAF6 <i>via</i> MSC-EV-carried miR-129, suggesting a regulatory network involved in the wound healing process in T1DM."

Here, we present a case of fulminant type 1 diabetes mellitus where the patient was initially misdiagnosed with gastroenteritis and acute pancreatitis. A 50-year-old Japanese woman was referred to our hospital with coma and shock. She had presented with nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and thirst from 5 days before admission, and had been misdiagnosed with gastroenteritis by her primary care physician. Upon examination, metabolic acidosis and remarkable elevation of pancreatic exocrine enzymes were found (amylase 4322 IU/L, lipase 1046 IU/L). Acute pancreatitis was initially suspected because of the high pancreatic enzyme levels and abdominal pain. However, her plasma glucose level was markedly elevated at 1357 mg/dL. The patient was diagnosed with fulminant type 1 diabetes mellitus. Computed tomography showed no radiological evidence of acute pancreatitis. In conclusion, fulminant type 1 diabetes mellitus is often referred to hospital with flu-like or gastrointestinal symptoms and elevation of serum pancreatic enzymes.

This longitudinal study included 1177 participants (526 with type 1 diabetes mellitus [T1DM] and 651 without) from the Coronary Artery Calcification in Type 1 Diabetes study. Dietary assessment and anthropometric and biochemical measurements were assessed at baseline and 14-year follow-up. MetS status was defined using the Harmonization criteria. EDIP scores were computed based on a food frequency questionnaire. Generalized linear mixed models were applied and subgroup analyses were performed by diabetes status. Mean age of study participants was 38 years and 48% were male at baseline. EDIP was positively associated with MetS (β<sub>T3 versus T1</sub>=0.81, P < .01) in T1DM but not in nondiabetic controls. Of the MetS components, low HDL-C and hypertriglyceridemia had positive associations with EDIP in both groups. Individuals with T1DM consumed more pro-inflammatory diets and had a greater risk of developing MetS than those without diabetes. The consumption of processed meat, red meat, high- and low- energy beverages was significantly higher in those with MetS than those without this condition (all P < .05). Reduced consumption of pro-inflammatory foods such as processed meat, red meat, sugar-sweetened beverages, and diet drinks may lower MetS risk in T1DM."

In addition to well-established pathogenic effector T cells, regulatory T cells (Tregs) have also been shown to be defective in T1D. Thus, an increasing number of therapeutic approaches are being developed to target Tregs. However, the role and mechanisms of TGF-β-induced Tregs (iTregs) in T1D remain poorly understood. Here, using a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced preclinical T1D mouse model, we found that iTregs could ameliorate the development of T1D and preserve β cell function. The preventive effect was associated with the inhibition of type 1 cytotoxic T (Tc1) cell function and rebalancing the Treg/Tc1 cell ratio in recipients. Furthermore, we showed that the underlying mechanisms were due to the TGF-β-mediated combinatorial actions of mTOR and TCF1. In addition to the preventive role, the therapeutic effects of iTregs on the established STZ-T1D and nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse models were tested, which revealed improved β cell function. Our findings therefore provide key new insights into the basic mechanisms involved in the therapeutic role of iTregs in T1D."

The classic view is that autoreactive T cells mistakenly destroy healthy ('innocent') β-cells. We propose an alternative view in which the β-cell is the key contributor to the disease. By their nature and function, β-cells are prone to biosynthetic stress with limited measures for self-defence. β-Cell stress provokes an immune attack that has considerable negative effects on the source of a vital hormone. This view would explain why immunotherapy at best delays progression of type 1 diabetes mellitus and points to opportunities to use therapies that revitalize β-cells, in combination with immune intervention strategies, to reverse the disease. We present the case that dysfunction occurs in both the immune system and β-cells, which provokes further dysfunction, and present the evidence leading to the consensus that islet autoimmunity is an essential component in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes mellitus. Next, we build the case for the β-cell as the trigger of an autoimmune response, supported by analogies in cancer and antitumour immunity.

In addition, HDPs-2A up-regulated PDX-1, activated and up-regulated IRS2 expression, and regulated apoptosis and regeneration of islet β cells to recover islet β-cell function injury in TIDM rats. HDPs-2A also up-regulated the expression of pancreatic GK and GLUT2 to improve insulin secretion ability of islet β-cells, ultimately improving the glucose metabolism disorder of T1DM rats. Moreover, HDPs-2A significantly up-regulated the expression of GK and down-regulated the expression of G6Pase in liver to improve liver glycogen synthesis, inhibit liver gluconiogenesis, and improve liver glucose metabolism disorder of T1DM rats. In summary, the hypoglycemic mechanisms of HDPs-2A may include regulating the regeneration and apoptosis of islet β-cells and activating liver glycometabolism-related signaling pathways in T1DM rats."

Previous studies showed that DIHS is associated with the onset of fulminant type 1 diabetes mellitus (FT1D). Although genetic background and abnormalities in immune response or viral infection are considered to be associated with pathogenesis of FT1D, it remains unclear whether virus infection and specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing are involved in DIHS-associated FT1D. Here, we report a case of a 78-year-old female patient with FT1D after DIHS treatment. She was diagnosed as DIHS caused by carbamazepine, and treatment with predonisolone was initiated. After 46 days from the occurrence of DIHS, she was admitted to our hospital because of type 1 diabetes mellitus and diabetic ketoacidosis. Although her Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was elevated by predonisolone treatment (HbA1c: 9.2%), we diagnosed her as fulminant type 1 diabetes mellitus considering the abrupt onset of the ketoacidosis. Her general condition was improved by treatment with fluid infusion and insulin administration. During her clinical course, the infection of coxsackie B4 virus was observed. In addition, the examination of HLA typing showed HLA-A24 haplotype. These findings suggest that the coxsackie B4 virus infection may be involved in the pathogenesis of DIHS-induced FT1D, and that HLA-A24 haplotype might relate to DIHS-associated FT1D."

APS3 is rare, and its pathogenesis is unclear. We describe a female patient with APS3 whose human leukocyte antigen (HLA) type could provide a clue to the pathogenesis of APS3. CASE REPORT A 40-year-old Japanese female patient who had been diagnosed with MG at 5 years of age, and which had been treated with cholinesterase inhibitors, was referred to our hospital with thirst, polydipsia, polyuria, weight loss, and hyperglycemia. She was found to have type 1 diabetes mellitus based on laboratory tests. She was also positive for anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody and was thus diagnosed with Hashimoto disease. This combination of type 1 diabetes mellitus, myasthenia gravis, and Hashimoto disease led to a diagnosis of APS3. Her HLA serotype was A24; B46/54; DR4/9; DQ8/9, and genotype was A*24: 02; B*46: 01: 01/54: 01: 01; C*01: 02; DRB1*04: 06/09: 01: 02; DQB1*03: 02: 01/03: 03: 02; and DQA1*03: 01/03: 02: 01. We subsequently reviewed 10 cases of APS3 combined with MG, including the present case and cases reported in Japanese. This review revealed that HLA-DR9/DQ9 might be a specific HLA subtype associated with APS3 with MG. Four of the 10 cases had MG diagnosed before diabetes mellitus and autoimmune thyroid disease. CONCLUSIONS The present case showed that, in people with HLA-B46 and -DR9, antibody-negative MG can precede the development of APS3 by many years. Physicians should consider the possibility of APS3 when evaluating patients with ocular-type myasthenia gravis, and screen them for type 1 diabetes."

Microbiome modulated by antibiotics seems to serve as one of the environmental factors which could influence the development of T1DM. Mitochondria, as autochthonous environmental bacteria living in our cells, and other bacteria share many common enzymes including beta-lactamases and it is supported by evidence that some beta-lactamase inhibitors are able to interact with counterpart enzymes. Thus, antibiotics may utilize two different pathways influencing the development of T1DM; one through modulation of microbiome and a second one via the interaction of mitochondrial enzymes. Data of consumption of penicillin (both narrow and broad spectrum) and beta-lactamase inhibitors in 30 European countries were collected from the database of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. These data were correlated with the prevalence reported by the International Diabetes Federation (2019) referring to type 1 diabetes in Europe. No correlation was found between total penicillin consumption or use of broad spectrum penicillin and the prevalence of type 1 diabetes. Nevertheless, broad spectrum penicillin, in combination with beta-lactamase inhibitor, was in inverse correlation with the prevalence of type 1 diabetes (r = - 0.573, p = 0.001). On the other hand, narrow spectrum penicillin was in positive correlation with type 1 diabetes (r = 0.523, p = 0.003). Prevalence of type 1 diabetes showed an inverse correlation with the use of beta-lactamase inhibitors and a positive one with that of narrow spectrum penicillin. Such a detailed analysis has not so far been provided referring to the penicillin group. In the background of this association either microbiomal or direct mitochondrial effects can be supposed."

Zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8), a novel islet autoantigen, is specifically expressed in insulin-containing secretory granules of β-cells. Genetic studies show that the genotypes of SLC30A8 can determine either protective or diabetogenic response depending on environmental and lifestyle factors. The ZnT8 protein expression, as well as zinc content in β-cells, was decreased in diabetic mice. Thus, ZnT8 might participate in insulin biosynthesis and release, and subsequently involved deteriorated β-cell function through direct or indirect mechanisms in type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus. From a clinical feature standpoint, the prevalence of ZnT8A is gradiently increased in type 2 diabetes mellitus, latent autoimmune diabetes in adults and type 1 diabetes mellitus. The frequency and epitopes of ZnT8-specific T cells and cytokine release by ZnT8-specific T cells are also different in diabetic patients and healthy controls. Additionally, the response to ZnT8 administration is also different in type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus. In the present review, we summarize the literature about clinical aspects of ZnT8 in the pathogenesis of diabetes, and suggest that ZnT8 might play a different role between type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

In that sense, evidence indicates that the anticonvulsant pregabalin is highly effective in treating severe cases of anxiety, as well as PTSD and diabetic neuropathic pain which is also very prevalent in T1DM. Herein, the short- and long-term effects of a single injection of pregabalin on the acquisition of a fear extinction memory and parameters of anxiety in induced-T1DM animals were investigated. For that, we used the contextual fear conditioning (CFC) and elevated plus maze paradigms, respectively. A putative antioxidant activity was also evaluated. Our findings demonstrated that induced-T1DM animals presented greater expression of fear memory, difficulty in extinguishing this fear memory, associated with a more pronounced anxiety-like response. Pregabalin was able to induce a short and long-lasting effect by facilitating the acquisition of the fear extinction memory and inducing a later anxiolytic-like effect. Also, the increased lipid peroxidation levels in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of induced-T1DM rats were reduced after pregabalin injection, while the decreased levels of reduced glutathione were increased in the hippocampus. Despite the need for more studies to understand the mechanism of action of pregabalin under these conditions, our data demonstrate for the first time that a single injection of pregabalin in a specific time window was able to improve behavioral parameters in addition to inducing neuroprotective effect. Thus, pregabalin has potential worth exploring for the treatment of PTSD and/or Anxiety associated with T1DM."

In Japan, FT1DM accounts for approximately 20% of acute-onset adult type 1 diabetes mellitus cases; however, reports of pediatric-onset FT1DM are rare. We aimed to determine the frequency and clinical characteristics of FT1DM in Japanese children and adolescents by conducting a 2-phase questionnaire survey among the members of the Japanese Study Group of Insulin Therapy for Childhood and Adolescent Diabetes (JSGIT) regarding their clinical experience with FT1DM. Responses were obtained from 54 of the 79 participating hospitals (68.4%). Of these, 8 hospitals managed a total of 15 pediatric patients with FT1DM (4 patients in each of 2 hospitals, 2 patients in 1 hospital, and 1 patient in each of 5 hospitals). The distribution of patient age was biphasic, with peaks in children younger than 5 years and older than 8 years of age. The clinical characteristics of FT1DM in this population (such as the duration from onset of symptoms to diagnosis, severity of symptoms, preceding flu-like episodes, and abnormal laboratory data) did not differ from those of patients with adult-onset FT1DM. The frequency of pediatric-onset FT1DM is low compared with that of adult-onset FT1DM. The genetic background and susceptibility patterns of pediatric patients with FT1DM may differ from those typical of adults with FT1DM, but both age groups share similar clinical characteristics."

Methods Forty-one children with T1DM and 41 age- and gender-matched healthy children were included in the study. Demographical characteristics of all cases were examined. In echocardiography; in addition to conventional echocardiographic measurements, end-systolic EATT was measured from right ventricular free wall. In electrocardiogram; Pd, QTd, QTcd and Tp-e interval durations, as well as Tp-e/QT and Tp-e/QTc ratios were calculated. Correlation values between EATT and electrocardiographic parameters were also noted. Results Mean age of the patient group was determined to be 12.43 ± 3.04 years and that of the control group was determined to be 12.08 ± 2.56 years. There was no significant difference between the groups in regard to age, gender, body weight, height and body mass index. In the patient group; EATT, Pd, QTd, QTcd and Tp-e interval were determined to be significantly higher compared to the control group. In the patient group, no significant correlation was determined between EATT and Pd, QTd, QTcd and Tp-e. However, when both patient and control groups were evaluated together, a statistically significant positive correlation was determined between EATT and Pd, QTd, QTcd and Tp-e. Conclusions In children with T1DM, an increase in epicardial adipose tissue thickness and in risk of cardiac arrhythmias has been demonstrated. To reveal the possible unfavorable effects of EATT on cardiac conduction system in T1DM patients needs further studies."

All 3 drugs demonstrated statistically significant reductions in hemoglobin A<sub>1C</sub>, weight, and total daily insulin dose without an increased risk of hypoglycemia in up to 52 weeks of therapy. The incidence of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) was higher in patients on a SGLT inhibitor at all doses, with the exception of empagliflozin 2.5 mg (0.8% vs 1.2% with placebo). <b>Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice:</b> SGLT inhibitors are potential adjuncts to insulin in T1DM patients, providing clinically meaningful benefits. Regulatory bodies have either approved or are reviewing these agents for use in T1DM. Clinicians should be familiar with the DKA risk associated with SGLT inhibitors and utilize DKA risk-mitigation strategies. Empagliflozin 2.5 mg warrants additional investigation given its efficacy without an increased incidence of DKA. <b>Conclusions:</b> Phase 3 trial data of SGLT inhibitors provide evidence for sustained efficacy in T1DM patients. Appropriate patient selection for therapy and routine monitoring are essential to minimize associated risks."

Regarding the speed of β-cell destruction, there are large variations depending on age. In some adult cases, sufficient β-cell function is sometimes retained for a relatively long period and eventually they become dependent on insulin for survival. It is known that even in subjects with T1DM showing high titers of such antibodies, insulin secretory capacity is preserved under several conditions such as ""honeymoon"" period and slowly progressive T1DM (SPIDDM). Herein, we reported the acute onset T1DM subject with long-term preservation of β-cell function, although his anti-GAD antibody and anti-IA-2 antibody titers were very high for more than 4 years. This case is very important in that his β-cell function was preserved with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor alone.

However, direct administration of autoantigens via oral route exhibits a low tolerance-inducing effect as a result of the digestion of protein antigens in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and therefore, a large dosage of autoantigens may be needed. In this study, bacterium-like particles (BLPs) made from food-grade lactic acid bacteria were used to deliver the intracellular domain of the insulinoma-associated protein 2 (IA-2ic). For this purpose, BLPs-IA-2ic vaccine in which IA-2ic bound to the surface of BLPs was constructed.

Medical records of transgender patients were analyzed retrospectively. From January 1, 2007 until October 10, 2016, 1,081 transgender patients presented at a tertiary reference center to start hormonal treatment. Nine of these 1,081 patients were previously diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus and 1 was diagnosed with latent autoimmune diabetes in adults. A 2.3-fold higher prevalence of type 1 diabetes mellitus was observed in transgender patients. We concluded that type 1 diabetes mellitus was more prevalent in transgender patients than one would expect from population prevalences. This could be a spurious result in a local cohort, because a causal relation seems unlikely, but our finding might encourage other centers to investigate this putative association.

We hypothesized that in pediatric patients with DM1, impairment of macrocirculation could be further augmented by a coexisting autoimmune process. Therefore, we investigated the influence of AIT on large arteries in DM1 pediatric patients. Our group consisted of 19 DM1, 19 DM1 + AIT patients and 29 control subjects. The groups were comparable regarding age and gender. The DM1 and DM1 + AIT patients were matched for age at onset of DM1 and diabetes duration. Macrocirculation was described using pulsatility indices (PIs) determined for common carotid (CCA) and peripheral arteries of upper and lower limbs. CCA resistance index (RI) and ABI were also assessed. Children with DM1 + AIT had only significantly lower CCA_PI and CCA_RI in comparison with controls whereas in the absence of AIT such difference was not found. The diabetes duration and age of onset did not correlate with carotid indices. Total cholesterol level was higher both in DM1 + AIT and DM1 groups than in the control group. For low density lipoproteins cholesterol, a significant difference was found between DM1 + AIT and control groups. Age-independent impact of AIT on CCA_PI was confirmed by multivariate analysis.

Presently, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a potential curative therapy for IPEX syndrome, but not for T1D. Generally, after complete loss of pancreatic β-cells, HSCT cannot improve the prognosis of T1D. Here, we report the case of a 16-year-old adolescent with late-onset of FOXP3 R347H mutation associated IPEX syndrome with T1D, where insulin dependency was ameliorated following HSCT. This patient with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus required insulin dosage of 1.28 U/kg/day for 1 month before HSCT. Although the results of glucose homeostasis before HSCT revealed impaired insulin secretion and low ΔC-peptide immunoreactivity (CPR, 1.0 ng/mL), the patient withdrew insulin infusion and remained euglycemic at 15 months after HSCT, and had normal β-cell function with improved ΔCPR (3.4 ng/mL) at 20 months after HSCT. The present case suggests that HSCT for T1D-associated IPEX syndrome improves Treg deficiency and prevents elimination of β-cells. We speculate that the period from the onset of T1D to HSCT could affect the therapeutic efficacy for T1D with IPEX, and early intervention with HSCT before or immediately after the onset of DM can rescue β-cells and remit T1D completely. Our study elaborates not only the therapeutic strategy for T1D with IPEX, but also the pathogenic mechanism in general T1D."

The risks of cardiovascular and renal disease in those with multiple autoimmune diseases have not been fully described. <b><i>Materials and Methods:</i></b> Using a national database from a large health insurer in the United States (years 2001-2017) containing ∼75 million members, we calculated age- and sex-specific co-prevalence of 12 autoimmune disorders for individuals with type 1 diabetes. We then evaluated whether concomitant autoimmune diseases were associated with renal failure, ischemic stroke, and myocardial infarction. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Of the 179,248 people diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, 1 in 4 had a concomitant autoimmune disease (27.03%; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 26.83%-27.24%), with hypothyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis, and celiac disease being the most common. The prevalence of autoimmune disease was 1.9 times greater in female than male patients (<i>p</i> < 0.001). In female patients with type 1 diabetes, one in three had another autoimmune disease (35.62%; 95% CI = 35.30%-35.94%) compared with one in five male patients (19.17%; 95% CI = 18.92%-19.42%). The risk of renal failure, ischemic stroke, and myocardial infarction increased with a greater number of concomitant autoimmune diseases (<i>p</i> < 0.001, test for trend for both female and male patients).

In recent years, many cases of gut microbiota transplantation for diseases of the bowel and beyond have been reported worldwide, and this approach has been shown to be safe and effective. Here, we conducted an experimental treatment study in two adolescent patients diagnosed with autoimmune T1DM for one year. Patients received one to three rounds of normal fecal microbiota transplants (FMT) and were followed for up to 30 weeks. Clinical outcomes were measured, including biochemical indices, medication regimen, and dosage adjustment. Fecal microbiota metagenomic sequencing after transplantation provides a reference for more reasonable and effective microbiota transplantation protocols to treat autoimmune T1DM.

Therefore, we diagnosed a hyperosmolar-hyperglycemic state and he was admitted to the hospital for treatment. He had had no previous upper respiratory symptoms, and his postprandial plasma glucose and glycated hemoglobin were normal 13 days before he was first assessed (90 mg/dL and 5.9%, respectively). On admission, his serum pancreatic exocrine enzyme activities were high and he was negative for islet-specific autoantibodies. His serum C-peptide concentration was 0.60 ng/mL, suggesting that his endogenous insulin secretion was partially intact at that time. Although he did not meet the diagnostic criteria, we suspected him of having fulminant type 1 diabetes mellitus, because of the abrupt onset of hyperosmolar-hyperglycemic state.

These disorders are characterized by the presence of antibodies against tissue transglutaminase, thyroglobulin, and thyroid peroxidase (TPO), as well as against gastric parietal cells. Cross-sectional studies have reported that the risk of autoimmune thyroid diseases in patients with type-1 DM is two- to threefold higher than in the general population. However, there are a few studies in the literature that investigated the relationship between malignancy and type-1 DM, and it has been shown that type-1 DM does not increase thyroid cancer. Furthermore, there is a lot of controversy regarding the role of thyroid autoimmunity in the pathogenesis of thyroid cancer. Here, a type-1 DM patient diagnosed with papillary thyroid cancer is presented. Case Report: Herein, it was aimed to present a 20-year-old female patient diagnosed with type-1 DM and subsequently with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). Thyroid ultrasound revealed a 10×12×18 mm hypoechoic irregular edges nodule with macrocalcification and microcalcification foci in the left lobe and pathological lymph nodes without echogenic hilus were detected at the fourth level of the left cervical chain. Fine needle aspiration biopsy of the nodule was consistent with papillary thyroid carcinoma. Total thyroidectomy, bilateral central lymph node dissection, and left neck dissection (level II to IV) were performed. Pathological examination revealed a 1.4× 0.9 cm diameter papillary carcinoma located in the left lobe of the thyroid gland with 13 lymph node metastases. Conclusion: Patients with type 1 DM should be examined for thyroid diseases, and patients with suspected thyroid disease should be evaluated with a thyroid ultrasound. Type 1 DM and PTC can coexist, albeit very rare. It should be known that type 1 diabetes can be observed together with thyroid cancer."

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a novel class of endogenous RNAs with covalently closed loop structures, implicated in various disease processes. However, their impact on macrophage activation and T1DM pathogenesis remains elusive. <b>Methods:</b> circRNA expression profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from T1DM children were determined by whole transcriptome microarray. Bioinformatics, quantitative real-time PCR, Western blot, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), cell co-culture, cell proliferation, and cell apoptosis assays were performed to investigate the expression, function, and regulatory mechanisms of <i>circPPM1F in vitro</i>. The regulatory role of <i>circPPM1F in vivo</i> was evaluated in the streptozocin-induced diabetic mouse model. <b>Results:</b> We identified 27 upregulated and 31 downregulated differentially expressed circRNAs in T1DM patients. <i>circPPM1F</i>, a circRNA with unknown function, was dominantly expressed in monocytes and significantly upregulated in T1DM patients. Functionally, <i>circPPM1F</i> promoted lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced M1 macrophage activation via enhancement of the NF-κB signaling pathway. Mechanistically, <i>circPPM1F</i> competitively interacted with HuR to impair the translation of protein phosphatase, Mg<sup>2+</sup>/Mn<sup>2+</sup> dependent 1F (PPM1F), thus alleviating the inhibitory effect of PPM1F on the NF-κB pathway. Moreover, eukaryotic initiation factor 4A-III (EIF4A3) and fused in sarcoma (FUS) coordinately regulated <i>circPPM1F</i> expression during M1 macrophage activation. In addition, <i>circPPM1F</i> could exacerbate pancreas injury in the streptozocin-induced diabetic mice by activation of M1 macrophages <i>in vivo</i>. <b>Conclusions:</b> <i>circPPM1F</i> is a novel positive regulator of M1 macrophage activation through the <i>circPPM1F</i>-HuR-PPM1F-NF-κB axis. Overexpression of <i>circPPM1F</i> could promote pancreatic islet injury by enhancing M1 macrophage activation and <i>circPPM1F</i> may serve as a novel potential therapeutic target for T1DM in children."

The increased risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), including euglycemic DKA, has led many to be wary of their use in T1D, especially given limited pediatric data and data regarding cardiorenal protection in this population. The phase 3 trials of these agents in T1D have yielded lower HbA1c, decreased total daily insulin dose, and small but significant weight loss with no increase in hypoglycemia. These trials also reported increased risks of genital mycotic infection and DKA. SGLT inhibitors have been approved as adjunctive therapy to insulin in adults with T1D in Europe and Japan, but the United States Food and Drug Administration has rejected similar applications.

The aim of this study was to determine the impact of glycemic control, vascular oxidative stress and inflammation on vascular health in adolescents with T1DM. Methods This was a cross-sectional study in adolescents with age- and sex-matched T1DM who were ≥12 years and were at least 2 years post-diagnosis. Recruitment was balanced to include individuals with hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) ≤8.5% (n=27) or with HbA1c ≥9.5% (n=25). Biomarkers of inflammation were measured in the blood including C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), E-selectin, fibrinogen and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Carotid intima media thickness (cIMT) and peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT) were assessed. Results Plasma E-selectin level was significantly different between the two groups with higher levels in the group with HbA1c ≥9.5% (65.0±27.7 ng/mL vs. 48.8±21.5 ng/mL, p=0.02). Though cIMT and PAT were not significantly different between the groups, Pearson correlation showed a significant direct relationship between rising HbA1c and mean right cIMT (p=0.02; r=0.37), PAT (p=0.03, r=0.31) and fibrinogen (p=0.03, r=0.03). Conclusions Elevated E-selectin level is an early marker of oxidative stress in T1DM patients with an elevated HbA1c level. Suboptimal glycemic control as evidenced by a rising HbA1c causes early atherosclerosis."

Seventy-one patients (7-13 years) with T1D and their caregivers were administered a survey created ad hoc and some standardized questionnaires, assessing psychological well-being and anxiety. Medical data (physical and biochemical characteristics) were recorded before (T<sub>0</sub>, January-February) and after (T<sub>1</sub>, May-June) the lockdown. Paired Student <i>t</i>-test, Spearman two-tailed correlations, and a linear regression model were used for statistical analysis. Children at T<sub>1</sub> showed higher BMI (body mass index), daily total and basal insulin dose, and time spent in therapeutic range, and they showed lower HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin), time spent above the therapeutic range, and standard deviations of the mean glucose values than at T<sub>0</sub>. A total of 32.9% scored in the clinical range for separation anxiety. The increase in separation anxiety was predicted by younger age, female gender, more recent T1D diagnosis, less time spent in therapeutic range at T<sub>1</sub>, and higher perceived fear of COVID-19 infection. In a pandemic context, separation anxiety may be stronger in younger females, with more recent T1D diagnosis and poor metabolic control, thus affecting the parent's ability to manage diabetes and to support children's autonomy."

Overall, 202 patients with T1DM were registered in our study, and 192 were eligible for analysis. Baseline characteristics and laboratory values were determined. Patients completed the Japanese versions of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Diabetes Therapy-Related QOL (DTR-QOL) questionnaires. We investigated the relationship between the global PSQI and DTR-QOL total scores by using linear regression analysis. In univariate regression analysis, DTR-QOL total scores were associated with body mass index, alcohol consumption, hypertension, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and global PSQI score (all p-value <0.05) but not with sleep duration. When the association between PSQI subscales and DTR-QOL total scores was examined, DTR-QOL total scores were significantly related to subjective sleep quality and daytime dysfunction. In a multivariate regression analysis, the global PSQI score was negatively related to DTR-QOL total scores. Patients with an HbA1c concentration ≥8.0% had significantly lower DTR-QOL total scores. We revealed a relationship between QOL and sleep quality in T1DM patients and showed that the relationship between QOL and PSQI subscales in T1DM patients may be different from that in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Assessing and managing sleep quality may be necessary for patients with diabetes to improve QOL."

Luckily, a counterregulatory response (1) system exists to help minimize and reverse hypoglycemia, although more studies are needed to better characterize its components. Recently, we showed that the hormone ghrelin is permissive for the normal CRR to insulin-induced hypoglycemia when assessed in mice without diabetes. Here, we tested the hypothesis that ghrelin also is protective against insulin-induced hypoglycemia in the streptozotocin (2) mouse model of type 1 diabetes. STZ-treated ghrelin-knockout (KO) (3) mice as well as STZ-treated wild-type (WT) littermates were subjected to a low-dose hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemic clamp procedure. The STZ-treated ghrelin-KO mice required a much higher glucose infusion rate than the STZ-treated WT mice. Also, the STZ-treated ghrelin-KO mice exhibited attenuated plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine responses to the insulin-induced hypoglycemia. Taken together, our data suggest that without ghrelin, STZ-treated mice modeling type 1 diabetes are unable to mount the usual CRR to insulin-induced hypoglycemia."

Tibial shear stiffness by pQCT-FEA was also lower in T1DM subjects than in controls at both the 4% site (by 17.1%; 337.4 ± 75.5 vs 407.1 ± 75.4 kN/mm, p < 0.01) and 66% site (by 7.9%; 1113.0 ± 158.6 vs 1208.8 ± 161.8 kN/mm, p = 0.03). These differences remained statistically significant after adjustment for confounding factors. No difference between groups was observed in DXA-determined variables (all p ≥ 0.08), although there was a trend towards lower aBMD at the lumbar spine in T1DM subjects than in controls after adjustment for confounders (p = 0.053). These novel findings elicited using pQCT and pQCT-FEA suggest a clinically significant impact of T1DM on bone strength in young adult females with T1DM. Peripheral QCT and pQCT-FEA may provide more information than DXA alone on bone fragility in this population. Further longitudinal studies with a larger sample size are warranted to understand the evolution and causes of bone fragility in young T1DM females."

Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation is a promising treatment for T1DM but is limited by several factors in the diabetic host. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that dysbiotic gut microbiota may limit MSC therapy, and modulating gut microbiota may help to improve the effects of MSC transplantation. <b>Methods:</b> NOD/Ltj mice, treated with adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs), were fed with an antibiotics cocktails (Abx) for 1 week. The blood glucose levels, insulitis, intestinal permeability and gut bacteria translocation to the pancreas were evaluated. 16s rRNA and colon tissue transcription sequencing were performed to analyze beneficial bacteria and reactive host biomolecules in the ADSCs+Abx group. Based on the sequencing results, specific bacteria were gavaged orally to diabetic mice to confirm their effect on ADSCs transplantation in T1DM was determined. <b>Results:</b> We found that the recolonized the diabetic gut microbiota abolished the therapeutic effect of ADSCs. On the contrary, depletion of the diabetic gut microbiota by antibiotics treatment in diabetic mice significantly enhanced the therapeutic effects of ADSCs as measured by reversal of hyperglycemia, insulitis, and increased insulin output. Mechanistically, treatment with antibiotics increased the abundance of <i>Bifidobacterium</i> in the gut and reduced bacterial translocation to the pancreas by promoting Mucin2 expression and thickening the mucus layer through TRPM7. The mechanism was confirmed the re-colonization of the gut by <i>B.breve</i> through oral gavage that produced similar results. <b>Conclusions:</b> These results provide the rationale for a new approach to improve MSC therapy for T1DM by altering the gut microbiota."

The complication of various autoimmune disorders is known as autoimmune polyglandular syndrome (APS). Once autoimmune thyroid disease develops, various autoimmune diseases can also occur. Such phenomena are classified as APS types 3A to 3D. In this report, we show the onset of T1DM in a patient with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Sjogren's syndrome. The most important and interesting point in this case is that, if we did not check her thyroid-associated antibodies, we could not have diagnosed her as APS. From the data of this case, we assumed that the patient suffered from APS type 3A, 3B, and 3D variants. This case pointed out very clearly the importance of testing for thyroid-associated antibodies under various autoimmune disease conditions even if the thyroid hormone levels are euthyroid. Moreover, based on the strong linkage between inflammatory bowel disease and T1DM and the compatibility with both T1DM and APS type 3, we think it is possible that Hashimoto's disease is present under complicated conditions together with UC and T1DM. It would be important to repeatedly check for thyroid-associated antibodies even in euthyroid patients, especially under various autoimmune disease conditions."

Numerous therapeutic approaches have been taken to search for substitutes of β-cells, among which stem cell transplantation is one of the most promising alternatives. Stem cells have demonstrated the potential efficacy to treat T1DM by reconstitution of immunotolerance and preservation of islet β-cell function in recent research. cGMP-grade stem cell products have been used in human clinical trials, showing that stem cell transplantation has beneficial effects on T1DM, with no obvious adverse reactions. To better achieve remission of T1DM by stem cell transplantation, in this work, we explain the progression of stem cell transplantation such as mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), and bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells (BM-HSCs) to restore the immunotolerance and preserve the islet β-cell function of T1DM in recent years. This review article provides evidence of the clinical applications of stem cell therapy in the treatment of T1DM."

The glutamate transporter solute carrier family 1, member 2 (GLT1/EAAT2) is expressed on the membrane of pancreatic β-cells and physiologically controls extracellular glutamate concentrations thus preventing glutamate-induced β-cell death. We hypothesized that GLT1 could be an immunological target in T1DM and that autoantibodies against GLT1 could be pathogenic. Immunoprecipitation and ELISA experiments showed that sera from T1DM subjects recognized GLT1 expressed in brain, pancreatic islets, and GLT1-transfected COS7-cell extracts. We validated these findings in two cohorts of T1DM patients by quantitative immunofluorescence assays. Analysis of the combined data sets indicated the presence of autoantibodies against GLT1 in 32 of the 87 (37%) T1DM subjects and in none of healthy controls (n = 64) (p < 0.0001). Exposure of pancreatic βTC3 cells and human islets to purified IgGs from anti-GLT1 positive sera supplemented with complement resulted in plasma membrane ruffling, cell lysis and death. The cytotoxic effect was prevented when sera were depleted from IgGs. Furthermore, in the absence of complement, 6 out of 16 (37%) anti-GLT1 positive sera markedly reduced GLT1 transport activity in βTC3 cells by inducing GLT1 internalization, also resulting in β-cell death. In conclusion, we provide evidence that GLT1 is a novel T1DM autoantigen and that anti-GLT1 autoantibodies cause β-cell death through complement-dependent and independent mechanisms. GLT1 seems an attractive novel therapeutic target for the prevention of β-cell death in individuals with diabetes and prediabetes."

A total of 64 patients matched by age and sex were enrolled as the control group. During the program, the intervention group lost 3 cases and the control group lost 4 cases. Finally, there were 61 effective samples in the intervention group and 60 effective samples in the control group. The patients in the control group were given face-to-face education by a T1DM educator for about 2 hours. The patients in the intervention group were intervened according to TELSA structured education program. The level of glycosylated hemoglobin, the frequency of hypoglycemia, self-management ability and quality of life were evaluated before intervention, 6 months after intervention and 12 months after intervention. <b>Results:</b> The ages of the intervention group and the control group were 30.0(22.0,43.5) and 29.5(22.3,42.5) (<i>P</i>>0.05), and the proportions of males were 47.54%(29 cases) and 45.00%(27 cases), respectively (<i>P</i>>0.05). There were interaction effects (<i>P</i><0.05) on the level of glycosylated hemoglobin, self-management ability and quality of life in the two groups. At 6 and 12 months after intervention of TELSA structured education program, the level of glycosylated hemoglobin in the intervention group decreased from the baseline level (7.87±1.45)% to (7.23±1.06)% and (7.28±0.93)%, respectively, which was significantly lower than that in the control group at 6 months (7.72±1.20)% and at 12 months(7.76±1.24)% (all <i>P</i><0.05). After TELSA structured education intervention, the scores of self-management scale for adult type 1 diabetes mellitus (SMOD-CA) in the intervention group showed an upward trend (<i>P</i><0.001), and the scores of diabetes-specific quality of life scale (A-DQOL) showed a downward trend (<i>P</i><0.001). In contrast, there was no statistically significant difference in the trend of scores in the control group (<i>P</i>=0.853 and 0.227). The comparison between groups at different time points showed that at 6 and 12 months after the intervention, the SMOD-CA scores of the patients in the intervention group were higher than those in the control group (<i>P</i><0.001), and the A-DQOL scores were lower than those in the control group (<i>P</i><0.001). <b>Conclusions:</b> The TELSA structured education program can effectively ameliorate glycemic control, with the improvement of self-management ability and quality of life in adult T1DM patients."

What had been a death sentence became a manageable, albeit chronic, disease. Insulin did not cure the disease, as it did not address the actual disease process, but instead treated its sequelae, namely elevated blood sugars. Importantly, insulin administration fails to ensure normoglycaemia. Even with the most sophisticated 'near closed-loop' methods, glucose homeostasis is not restored to normal. T1DM patients face complications, both short-term, such as hypo- and hyperglycaemia, and long-term, with increased glycosylation of proteins leading to eye, kidney, nervous system and other sequelae. These complications are associated with significant morbidity and mortality even after intensive insulin treatment. Nearly 100 years after the discovery of insulin, we continue to face the challenge of addressing the disease process itself, in order to fundamentally improve the life of these patients. There are major efforts to achieve just that: to completely arrest the autoimmune process destroying the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, or at least significantly slow the process to blunt and delay short- and long-term complications. The aim of this Communication is to propose a novel assessment tool that would serve as a quantitative outcome measure by which therapies, short of clinical cure, may be compared and their true benefit to the treatment of diabetes assessed."

However, there are few studies of the prognostic and therapeutic values of the systemic autoimmune response in this pathology after transplant of autologous mesenchymal stem cells. Here, we present a 40-year-old patient with complications of type 1 diabetes mellitus (diabetic retinopathy) after mesenchymal stem cell transplant. Based on peripheral blood results, we were able to calculate integral hematologic parameters, allowing us to indirectly assess the patient's immune system after autologous mesenchymal stem cell transplant. One month after autologous mesenchymal stem cell transplant, we observed a positive immune response, with a 40% decrease in leukocyte intoxication index and a 22% increase from the initial lymphocyte and eosinophil ratio index values, which indicated the formation of a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction. Two months after transplant, stem cell leukocyte intoxication index, in contrast, increased by 10%, indicating a possible metabolic shift. At the same time, changes were observed in the lymphocyte stimulation index value, which increased by 11%. This observation indicated negative immunologic reactivity, namely, poor function of factors of nonspecific resistance due to autointoxication of the organism. However, 3 months after transplant, the hematologic parameters of this patient returned to levels before treatment. The use of integral hematologic parameters can indirectly interpret parallels between immunologic reactivity and metabolic disorders in type 1 diabetes mellitus complications (diabetic retinopathy) after autologous mesenchymal stem cell transplant. These parameters could become a diagnostic indicator in the correction of pathogenetic therapy."

The incidence of the disease is lower than that of type 2 DM and varies in different countries and ethnic groups, and the etiological and pathogenetic factors are different from T2DM. The aim of this overview is to investigate the effect of T1DM on all-cause mortality and CVD morbidity and mortality. During the last decades, the treatment of T1DM has improved the prognosis of the patients. Still, the mortality rates are higher than those of the age- and sex-matched general population. With the prolonged survival, the macrovascular complications and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) appear as major health problems in the management of patients with T1DM. The studies on the CVD morbidity and mortality in this disease group are sparse, but they reveal that T1DM is associated with at least 30% higher mortality. In comparison to healthy people, CVDs are more common in T1DM patients and they occur earlier in life. Furthermore, they are a major cause for death and impaired quality of life in T1DM patients.

Despite advances in insulin therapy, T1DM still leads to high morbidity and mortality in patients. A key focus of T1DM research has been to identify strategies that re-establish self-tolerance and suppress ongoing autoimmunity. Here, we describe a strategy that utilizes pretargeting and glycochemistry to bioengineer β cells <i>in situ</i> to induce β-cell-specific tolerance. We hypothesized that β-cell-targeted Ac<sub>4</sub>ManNAz-encapsulated nanoparticles deliver and establish β cells with high levels of surface reactive azide groups. We further theorized that administration of a dibenzylcyclooctyne (DBCO)-functionalized programmed death-ligand 1 immunoglobulin fusion protein (PD-L1-Ig) can be readily conjugated to the surface of native β cells. Using nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice, we demonstrated that our strategy effectively and selectively conjugates PD-L1 onto β cells through bioorthogonal stain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition.

In this paper, we report the outcomes of our investigation on the intradermal application of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (PDT) with curcumin in an infection induced by MRSA ATCC 43300 strain in the ear of mice with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). A solution containing 100 μg of curcumin was photoactivated ex vivo with a LED light (450 nm) delivering a fluency of 13.5 J/cm<sup>3</sup>. This solution was administered in the ear intradermally, at the same inoculum site as the MRSA ATCC 43300 strain (PDT Group). This study also included the use of two control groups (both infected): One was treated with saline and the other was treated with non-photoactivated curcumin. The animals were euthanized 24 h after these treatments and samples of draining lymph node and treated ear were collected for examination. The PDT group showed lower bacterial load in the draining lymph node when compared to the saline and curcumin groups (p-value <0.05) 24 h after treatment. In addition to bacterial load, the PDT group presented a higher concentration of nitrates and nitrites in the draining lymph node when compared to the saline and curcumin groups (p-value <0.001). Examining the infectious site, despite apparently having similar inflammatory cell recruitment compared with the control groups, the PDT group showed a profile with less intense activity in the myeloperoxidase expression when compared to the saline group (p-value <0.001). Additionally, the detected concentration of cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-12, and IL-10 was significantly lower in the PDT group when compared to the saline group (p-value <0.01; p-value <0.05; p-value <0.05, respectively), thus presenting a less intense inflammatory response during infection resolution. Our pilot study showed for the first time the therapeutic potential of PDT using curcumin when administered intradermally in the treatment of infections caused by S. aureus in mice with T1DM."
33944639,Sexual Dimorphism in Alternative Metabolic Pathways of L-Arginine in Circulating Leukocytes in Young People with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus.,['Arginase'],"['Nina Alchujyan', 'Margarita Hovhannisyan', 'Nina Movsesyan', 'Arthur Melkonyan', 'Vanuhi Shaboyan', 'Yelena Aghajanova', 'Grigory Minasyan', 'Guevork Kevorkian']","<b>Background</b>: Sexual dimorphism in specific biochemical pathways and immune response, underlies the heterogeneity of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and affects the outcome of immunotherapy. Arginase and nitric oxide (NO) synthase (NOS) metabolize L-arginine and play opposite roles in the immune response and autoimmune processes.<b>Objective:</b> We hypothesized that the above mentioned enzymes can be involved in sex and age differences in T1DM and its treatment. Based on this, the enzymes have been studied in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) and plasma of young people with T1DM.<b>Methods:</b> Patients were recruited from Muratsan University Hospital (Yerevan, Armenia) and were divided into groups: girls and boys by age, from children to adolescents and adolescents/young adults with recent-onset T1DM (RO-T1DM) (0.1-1 years) and long-term T1DM (LT-T1DM) (1.6-9.9 years). Arginase activity was assessed by L-arginine-dependent production of L-ornithine, and the NOS activity was assessed by NO/nitrite production. Glycemic control was assessed using hemoglobin A1c test. Plasma HbA1c concentration below 7.5% (median (range) 6.7 [6.2-7.5]) was taken as good glycemic control (+) and above 7.5% (median (range) 10.5 [7.6-13]) as poor glycemic control (-). Healthy volunteers with corresponding sex and age were used as the control group.<b>Results:</b> All the patients with RO-T1DM, with poor glycemic control, had increased arginase activity in the cytoplasm (cARG) and mitochondria (mARG) in PBL. In girls with RO-T1DM, with good glycemic control, the subcellular arginase activity decreased, and normalized in LT-T1DM, regardless of age. In contrast, boys from both age groups showed high arginase activity, regardless of glycemic control and duration of T1DM along with insulin therapy. At the same time, a significant decrease in the subcellular production of bioavailable NO was observed in children/preadolescents, regardless of glycemic control and duration of diabetes. In adolescents/young adult boys with RO-T1DM, with (-), the subcellular production of NO decreased significantly, and with LT-T1DM, the decrease was attenuated, but even with (+) remained lower than in healthy people. In contrast, in the group of same age girls with RO-T1DM, NO production increased above normal in both cellular compartments, while with LT-T1DM it normalized in the cytoplasm. In adolescents/young adults with LT-T1DM, NO production in PBL mitochondria decreased by almost a half, regardless of glycemic control and gender. Changes in the metabolic pathways of L-arginine in plasma differed and were less substantial than in the PBL cellular compartments in T1DM.<b>Conclusions:</b> Glycemic status and duration of T1DM along with insulin therapy affect the activity of arginase and NOS-dependent production of bioavailable NO in the cytoplasm and mitochondria in PBL of young patients with T1DM, depending on sex and age. Arginase and NOS can directly affect the processes occurring in the pancreas and the outcome of therapy through infiltrated leukocytes. Obtained data can be useful for understanding the heterogeneity of T1DM and using it to develop available criteria for assessing the severity and treatment of autoimmune diabetes."
35090949,Preventive treatment with fish oil facilitates the antidepressant-like effect of antidepressant drugs in type-1 diabetes mellitus rats: Implication of serotonergic system.,['Depression'],"['Ana Paula Farias Waltrick', 'Alvaro Henrique Bernardo de Lima Silva', 'Milene Cristina de Carvalho', 'Bruna Aparecida Comotti de Oliveira', 'Katya Naliwaiko', 'Joice Maria da Cunha', 'Janaina Menezes Zanoveli']","Treating depression associated with type-1 diabetesmellitus(T1DM) is a major clinical challenge. Fish oil (FO), composed mostly of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), has been pointed out as quite promising for the treatment of depression given its neuroprotective property. Although DHA and EPA exert several physiological actions, DHA is known to play a critical role in postnatal brain development. This study aimed to investigate the effect of preventive treatment with FO (with more DHA in the composition) alone or associated with antidepressant drugs on depression-like behaviors and brain monoamines levels of juvenile induced-T1DM rats. Thus, prepubescent rats were submitted to a prolonged treatment with vehicle (VEH) or FO (50% of DHA and 20% EPA) starting 4 weeks before the induction of experimental T1DM (on day 28) by streptozotocin. When combined, the treatment with vehicle, fluoxetine (FLX, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) or imipramine (IMI, a tricyclic antidepressant) started at week 6 (day 42) and lasted for 2 weeks (until day 56). The behavioral tests were conducted on days 55 and 56, followed by hippocampal and prefrontal cortex dissection for neurochemical analyses. Our results showed that induced-T1DM rats pretreated with FO showed a significant increase of EPA and DHA in plasma, indicative of an increase in the systemic availability of these acids. As previously observed, induced-T1DM rats presented increased immobility and decreased swimming and climbing frequencies in the modified forced swimming test, indicative of depressive-like behavior. Only the combined treatment - FO plus antidepressants (FLX or IMI - both in the highest dose) - was able to induce a significant improvement of depressive-like behaviors. Here, it is noteworthy that swimming behavior has been associated with an increase in serotonergic neurotransmission. Interestingly, our data showed that the combined treatment (FO + antidepressants - including the ineffective dose of FLX) was able to increase the swimming of animals more significantly compared to animals not pretreated with FO. In addition, confirming these assumptions, the decreased 5-HT levels in the hippocampus from induced-T1DM rats were increased after treatment with FLX (highest dose) or IMI (both doses), being this increase more pronounced in animal pretreated with FO. Intriguingly, in these animals pretreated with FO, the ineffective dose of FLX in association with FO was able to increase the levels of 5-HT. The decreased hippocampal levels of noradrenaline were increased only after IMI treatment, not being influenced by FO pretreatment. In conclusion, ours results pointed out that the choice of the DHA/EPA ratio may be an important factor to be considered for the FO antidepressant-like effectper se,but the FO treatment in this composition associated with the antidepressant drugs - especially that ones that increase preferentially the availability of 5-HT -, may represent a better alternative of treatment to individuals with T1DM-associated depression."

We aim to evaluate the influence of T1DM on male sexual function, quality of sexual life, and sex hormone levels. A total of 57 male patients aged 18 to 50 years (mean = 33) with T1DM (duration mean = 15 years) had a medical examination and completed a set of questionnaires - International Index of Erectile Function-5 (IIEF-5), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Sexual quality of life questionnaire male (SQoL-M). The prevalence of erectile dysfunction was 28.1% (IIEF-5 ≤21). Patients without diabetic nephropathy had better erectile function (p = 0.008). Subjects with better glycemic control (HbA<sub>1c</sub> <65 mmol/mol) had also better erectile function (p = 0.041). At least 8.8% patients had retrograde ejaculation. Blood serum levels of sex hormones were determined and compared to laboratory reference values of healthy men. Total testosterone level was not significantly changed, sex hormone binding globulin was higher (p < 0.001) and its level correlated with daily insulin dose adjusted to body weight (p = 0.008). Free androgen index and calculated free testosterone were lower (p = 0.013; p < 0.001), estradiol was not significantly changed, LH was higher (p < 0.001), FSH was unchanged, and prolactin was higher (p < 0.001). Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) negatively correlated with HbA<sub>1c</sub> (p < 0.001). To conclude, we found significant changes in sexual functions and sex hormone blood concentrations that indicate impairment of sexual and reproductive functions in T1DM males."

Cigarette smoking in adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus and congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Turk J Pediatr 2019; 61: 236-243. Adolescence is a long period involving many physical and psycho-social changes experienced during transition from childhood to adulthood. In this period, behaviors such as curiosity and risk-taking are common, and cigarette smoking initiation is one of those behaviors. In this study, it was aimed to find out whether chronic diseases are an effective factor or not in the cigarette smoking initiation of adolescents. One-hundred adolescents with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) and 50 adolescents with Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) aged 12 and above under follow-up at the Pediatric Endocrinology Clinic and 100 healthy adolescents within the same age group who applied to the Adolescent Outpatient Clinic were included in the study. A survey was applied to all of these adolescents, which had been developed by researchers and contained questions about their socio-demographic features and cigarette smoking. Fourteen (5.6%) of the 250 adolescents were smokers. The rate of those who tried, but quitted cigarette smoking was found as approximately 20%. Cigarette smoking rate of those with T1DM was 1%, of those with CAH was 4%, and of the healthy adolescents was 11%. Cigarette smoking was significantly lower in those with a chronic disease (2%) than those who were healthy (11%). Adolescents` parents and friends had an effect on the cigarette smoking initiation, and adolescents smoked their first cigarette generally because of curiosity. It was seen in this study that the adolescents with a chronic disease less frequently smoked cigarettes than the healthy adolescents, the rate of cigarette smoking in parents of cigarette smoking adolescents was very high, and their parents and friends had an effect on cigarette smoking initiation of adolescents."

This study aimed to assess the level of social avoidance and distress in emerging adults with T1DM, and to explore the correlation between social avoidance and distress and self-management or glycemic control. <b>METHODS</b>: A total of 342 T1DM patients aged 18-30 years old were recruited from 8 tertiary hospitals in Hunan Province from September 2014 to February 2019. The questionnaire included general information questionnaire, the Social Avoidance and Distress Scale (SAD), and Self-management Scale of Type 1 Diabetes for Chinese Adults (SMOD-CA). The total scores of SAD in emerging adult patients with T1DM were compared with those of norm. Correlation between glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and social avoidance and distress of emerging adult patients with T1DM was analyzed. <b>RESULTS</b>: The total score of SAD (11.13±6.18) in emerging adults with T1DM was significantly higher than that in healthy adults (<i>t</i>=77.06, <i>P</i><0.01). Pearson correlation analysis showed that the scores of SAD, social avoidance subscale, and social distress subscale were negatively correlated with the scores of SMOD-CA (all <i>P</i><0.01), and they were positively correlated with HbA1c (all <i>P</i><0.01). Multivariate linear regression analysis showed that social avoidance and distress, self-management, gender, and educational level were independent influential factors for HbA1c in emerging adults with T1DM. <b>CONCLUSION</b>: The degree of social avoidance and distress of emerging adult patients with T1DM is higher than that of healthy people. The higher the degree of social avoidance and distress, the lower the level of self-management and the worse the control of blood sugar. Attention should be paid to social avoidance and distress in emerging adults with T1DM, and targeted interventions should be formulated."

However, a diabetic patient's increased focus on diet and weight control,although necessary, can lead to disturbed eating habits, medical complications, and ""resistance"" to treatment. The term ""diabulimia"" refers to the eating disorder in which patients with T1DM take less insulinin order to control their weight. Currently there is no valid questionnaire in the Greek language for the detection of eating disorders in T1DM. This study examines the psychometric properties of the Greek version of the Diabetes Eating Problem Survey-Revised (DEPS-R), a questionnaire that assesses the risk of ""diabulimia""in patients with T1DM. 100 outpatients with a T1DM diagnosis of over one year -71 women and 35users of a continuous insulin infusion pump- were asked to complete the DEPS-R questionnaire translated into Greek (0-80 score range, >20 indicating high risk of disorders) along with the EAT-26 (0-78 score range,>20 indicating high risk of pathological eating behaviours or eating disorder) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-ΙΙ) (0-63 score range, >14 indicating high risk of major depressive disorder). The Greek versionof the DEPS-R showed strong internal consistency and construct validity (Cronbach's alpha=0,89 in total,0,90 in females and 0,85 in males). Factorial analysis revealed 4 factors (diet, weight loss, insulin use and compensatory behaviors) accounting for 65.68% of the total variance (19.90%, 18.50%, 15.64% and 11.65%of the total variance respectively). In addition, 35% of the sample scored above 20 on the EAT-26, 26% rated above 14 on the BDI-II and 40% had a score above 20 on the DEPS-R, while the average score was 19.22. The sound psychometric properties of the DEPS-R scale were confirmed for a Greek sample with T1DM suggesting that it could be used as a reliable tool for the detection of diabulimia. In addition, we found that Greek patients with T1DM appear to have an increased risk of developing eating disorders and depression."

The sample presented good glycemic control and 30.1% scored above the established DEPS-R cut-off score for disturbed eating behavior. CFA results revealed that the data fit well to the factor models. The DEPS-R scale had good reliability and was positively linked to BMI, HbA1c, total daily dose and time in range. Model comparison supported the superiority of the 1-factor model, implying that Greek clinicians and practitioners might not have to consider individualized treatment based on various scores across different subscales but they can adopt a single DEPS-R score for an easy and efficient screening for disordered eating."

Our results showed that severe type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) caused a higher expression of Hsp90α, but not Hsp70. Moreover, injections of the peroxiredoxin 6 antioxidant enzyme (PRDX6) did not affect the expression of these chaperones. Conversely, pro-inflammatory cytokines added to β-cells caused a significant increase in the expression of Hsp90α and, substantially, Hsp70. Moreover, cells cultivated in the presence of PRDX6 were more susceptible to the cytokine effect. Thus, in the course of severe alloxan-induced T1D, no protective role of the heat shock proteins, was revealed, and their expression level was not increased by PRDX6.

Enhanced platelet reactivity is considered a main determinant of the increased atherothrombotic risk of diabetic patients. Thrombopoietin (THPO), a humoral growth factor able to stimulate megakaryocyte proliferation and differentiation, also modulates the response of mature platelets by enhancing both activation and binding to leukocytes in response to different agonists. Increased THPO levels have been reported in different clinical conditions characterized by a generalized pro-thrombotic state, from acute coronary syndromes to sepsis/septic shock, and associated with elevated indices of platelet activation. To investigate the potential contribution of elevated THPO levels in platelet activation in T1DM patients, we studied 28 T1DM patients and 28 healthy subjects. We measured plasma levels of THPO, as well as platelet-leukocyte binding, P-selectin, and THPO receptor (THPOR) platelet expression. The priming activity of plasma from diabetic patients or healthy subjects on platelet-leukocyte binding and the role of THPO on this effect was also studied in vitro. T1DM patients had higher circulating THPO levels and increased platelet-monocyte and platelet-granulocyte binding, as well as platelet P-selectin expression, compared to healthy subjects, whereas platelet expression of THPOR did not differ between the two groups. THPO concentrations correlated with platelet-leukocyte binding, as well as with fasting glucose and Hb1Ac. In vitro, plasma from diabetic patients, but not from healthy subjects, primed platelet-leukocyte binding and platelet P-selectin expression. Blocking THPO biological activity using a specific inhibitor prevented the priming effect induced by plasma from diabetic patients. In conclusion, augmented THPO may enhance platelet activation in patients with T1DM, potentially participating in increasing atherosclerotic risk."

An alternative way to test classical HLA alleles is by using tag SNP. A set of tag SNP for several classical HLA alleles has been reported as associated with susceptibility or resistance to this disease in Europeans.
Objective: We aimed at validating the methodology based on tag SNP focused on the inference of classical HLA alleles, and at evaluating their association with type 1 diabetes mellitus in a sample of 200 families from Antioquia.
Materials and methods: We studied a sample of 200 families from Antioquia. Each family had one or two children with T1D. We genotyped 13 SNPs using tetra-primer ARMS-PCR or PCRRFLP. In addition, we tested the validity of the tag SNP reported for Europeans in 60 individuals from a population of Colombians living in Medellín (CLM) from the 1000 Genomes Project database. Statistical analyses included the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the transmission disequilibrium and the linkage disequilibrium tests.
Results: The linkage disequilibrium was low in reported tag SNP and classical HLA alleles in this CLM population. Association analyses revealed both risk and protection factors to develop type 1 diabetes mellitus. Appropriate tag SNPs for the CLM population were determined by using the genotype information available in the 1000 Genome Project database.
Conclusions: Although linkage disequilibrium patterns in this CLM population were different from those reported in Europeans, we did find strong evidence of the role of HLA in the development of type 1 diabetes mellitus in the study population."

Patients with T1DM and age- and sex-matched controls were included. Subjects with HHV infection were subgrouped into those with histories of varicella-zoster virus, herpes simplex virus (HSV), Epstein-Barr virus, and human cytomegalovirus infections. The odds ratio of the risk of T1DM was calculated using a multivariable conditional logistic regression model. Atopic diseases, autoimmune thyroid diseases, and history of enterovirus infection served as adjusted comorbidities. Our findings suggested a significant association between HSV infection and the risk of T1DM (adjusted odds ratio: 1.21; 95% CI: 1.01-1.47, <i>p</i> = 0.048), while infection with other HHVs was not.

Both glycemic control and adherence may be negatively impacted by poor psychological outcomes in adolescence, such as depressive symptoms and low hopefulness. The purpose of this study was to examine associations between the mealtime insulin bolus score (BOLUS), a more robust proxy measure of adherence than frequency of blood glucose monitoring or self-report, with depressive symptoms, hope, and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). Ninety adolescents completed measures of hope (Children's Hope Scale) and depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale), as well as lab-based measures of HbA1c and mealtime insulin bolus scores (BOLUS). Higher levels of hope were associated with lower levels of depressive symptoms, more frequent mealtime insulin boluses, and better glycemic control. Higher levels of BOLUS behavior were associated with lower depressive symptoms and better glycemic control. Both BOLUS behavior and hope independently and significantly impacted the relationship between depressive symptoms and HbA1c, suggesting a possible mediation. Since hope and BOLUS were each associated with the relationship between depressive symptoms and glycemic control, following confirmation of this relationship in a longitudinal study, clinics may consider measuring hope and BOLUS among youth with high depressive symptoms and further investigating BOLUS behavior and hope as potential intervention targets to improve glycemic control."

FOXO3, cooperatively with FOXO1, control the development and function of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells (T<sub>reg</sub>). Since the lack of T<sub>reg</sub>-mediated control has fundamental impact on type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) development, we investigated <i>FOXO3</i> expression in patients with T1DM. <i>FOXO3</i> expression was estimated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from newly diagnosed T1DM pediatric patients (<i>n</i> = 28) and age-matched healthy donors (<i>n</i> = 27) by reahavel-time PCR and TaqMan gene expression assays. Expression analysis revealed significant upregulation of <i>FOXO3</i> in T1DM (<i>P</i> = 0.0005). Stratification of the T1DM group according to the presence of initial diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) did not indicate differences in <i>FOXO3</i> expression in patients with DKA compared to a mild T1DM onset (<i>P</i> > 0.05). In conclusion, overexpression of <i>FOXO3</i> is correlated with the ongoing islet autoimmune destruction and might suggest a potential role for this gene in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes mellitus."
31287801,A novel individualized drug repositioning approach for predicting personalized candidate drugs for type 1 diabetes mellitus.,['drug repositioning'],['Hong Zheng'],"The existence of high cost-consuming and high rate of drug failures suggests the promotion of drug repositioning in drug discovery. Existing drug repositioning techniques mainly focus on discovering candidate drugs for a kind of disease, and are not suitable for predicting candidate drugs for an individual sample. Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is a disorder of glucose homeostasis caused by autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic β-cell. Here, we present a novel single sample drug repositioning approach for predicting personalized candidate drugs for T1DM. Our method is based on the observation of drug-disease associations by measuring the similarities of individualized pathway aberrance induced by disease and various drugs using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov weighted Enrichment Score algorithm. Using this method, we predicted several underlying candidate drugs for T1DM. Some of them have been reported for the treatment of diabetes mellitus, and some with a current indication to treat other diseases might be repurposed to treat T1DM. This study conducts drug discovery via detecting the functional connections among disease and drug action, on a personalized or customized basis. Our framework provides a rational way for systematic personalized drug discovery of complex diseases and contributes to the future application of custom therapeutic decisions."

The most critical outcome of hypopituitarism is caused by secondary adrenal insufficiency. Glucocorticoid deficiency is a life-threatening condition, and patients who develop this deficiency require prompt diagnosis and treatment. However, a delayed diagnosis of hypopituitarism may occur due to its non-specific clinical manifestations. A common presenting sign of glucocorticoid deficiency is hypoglycemia. The amelioration of hyperglycemia has been observed in diabetic patients with adrenal insufficiency. We report the case of a 70-year-old Japanese woman who had suffered from fatigue and anorexia for several months; she was admitted based on refractory hyponatremia (sodium 125-128 mEq/L) and hypoglycemia (glucose 58-75 mg/dL). Laboratory findings and magnetic resonance imaging findings led to the diagnosis of panhypopituitarism caused by autoimmune hypophysitis. After receiving 10 mg/day of hydrocortisone, the patient developed severe hyperglycemia (glucose >500 mg/dL). Undetectable C-peptide levels and positive results of both insulinoma-associated antigen-2 antibodies and insulin autoantibodies indicated that she had experienced a recent onset of type 1 diabetes. The pathophysiological process indicated that overt hyperglycemia could be masked by the deficient action of glucocorticoids even in a diabetic patient with endogenous insulin deficiency. This uncommon case reinforces the importance of the prompt diagnosis and treatment of hypopituitarism. Clinicians should remain aware of the possibility of hidden diabetes when treating hypoglycemia in patients with adrenal insufficiency."

The expression of <i>parp-1</i> and <i>bax</i> genes was estimated on mRNA levels using real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. <b>Results.</b> After 8 weeks, diabetic rats had weight loss, while blood glucose was increased about 4.9-fold compared to control group. Vitamin D<sub>3</sub> administration to diabetic animals had no effect on these parameters. It was found that total serum alkaline phosphatase activity was significantly elevated in diabetic rats as compared to control animals and was restored by vitamin D<sub>3</sub>. Diabetes was accompanied by reduction of nicotinamidadenindinucleotide, a substrate of poly-ADP-ribosylation, level by 31.7% as compared to control rats, which was not reversed in response to vitamin D<sub>3</sub> treatment. In diabetic hearts, the mRNA expression level of <i>parp-1</i> gene was 2.8-fold higher compared to control rats and partially decreased by vitamin D3 treatment. Less significant alterations were observed in diabetic hearts for the mRNA expression level of <i>bax</i> gene that was 2.0-fold higher compared to control animals and vitamin D<sub>3</sub> normalized it. These results indicate that cardiomyocytes have a tendency to apoptosis. <b>Conclusions.</b> The findings suggest that investigated genes can be targets at the transcriptional level for vitamin D action that may be contributed to the improving metabolic/signaling pathways induced by diabetes mellitus."

However, there is insufficient evidence in middle childhood on psychological mechanisms involved that might complicate the adaptation of these children. Therefore, 106 children (<i>N</i> = 31 with T1D and <i>N</i> = 75 as matched healthy group [HG]) aged 8 to 13 were assessed using the <i>Child Attachment Interview</i>, the <i>Child Behavior Checklist</i>, and the measure of glycated hemoglobin. Results showed that insecure T1D children did not have worse diabetes control than the secure ones. However, T1D children differed from HG for higher levels of idealization to father and withdrawn/depressed problems. Moreover, T1D children with insecure attachment to mother scored significantly higher in anxious/depressed, withdrawn/depressed, attention problems, and rule-breaking behavior, while T1D children with insecure attachment to father scored significantly higher only in the withdrawn/depressed scale compared to the remaining children. Therefore, diabetes does not in itself determine a psychological vulnerability in middle childhood, but the presence of an insecure attachment, especially to the mother, worsens the psychological adaptation of T1D children. Psychological support should be provided for these young patients and their families."

All T1D admissions to the 4 week Chronic Illness Management Program (CIMP) between 1 January 2016 and 31 December 2017 were eligible for inclusion. Data related to physiological and psychosocial outcomes were compared between admission and discharge. Follow-up data, including hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), psychosocial measures, and health care utilization, were collected at 3, 6, and 12 months after discharge to assess sustained changes. Fifty-seven T1D admissions were included in the sample. There was a significant reduction in mean HbA1c from admission (11.1%/98 mmol/mol) to discharge (9.1%/76 mmol/mol). Patients also demonstrated significant improvements in all psychosocial outcome measures. Improvements in HbA1c were sustained at 3 months follow-up; however, average values returned to baseline by 6 months follow-up. In contrast to preadmission history, the majority of the sample reported reduced crisis health care utilization 1 year after discharge. The inpatient setting provides an intensive treatment model for diabetes management that promotes sustainable behavior change 3 months after discharge. While additional community supports are needed for long-term improvement, this program model may benefit patients who have been unable to manage their diabetes with outpatient treatment and therapy alone."

Patients with diabetes are at a high risk of adverse outcomes after COVID-19 infection, whereas infection itself can be associated with severe hyperglycemia, including hyperglycemic emergencies. While the accelerated vaccine development and rollout have considerably decreased morbidity and mortality with reasonable safety, there are emerging reports of worsening of hyperglycemia in response to vaccination, with possible shared pathophysiology with COVID-19 infection-related hyperglycemia. We hereby report two young patients with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) who presented with severe diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) after receiving second doses of COVISHIELD (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) and COVAXIN (BBV152- inactivated whole virion) vaccines. Though a causal link cannot be established, post-vaccination immune response can potentially explain this transient worsening of hyperglycemia and hyperglycemic emergencies. We, hence report diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) following COVID-19 vaccination in T1DM. We suggest that people with diabetes, particularly patients with T1DM with inadequate glycemic control should ideally be closely monitored for hyperglycemia and ketonemia for at least 2 weeks after receiving vaccination for COVID 19."

Emerging evidence suggests that pancreatic islet microcirculation is impaired in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Here, we investigated the potential ultrastructural protective effects of insulin against streptozotocin (STZ)-induced ultrastructural abnormalities of the pancreatic islet microcirculation in T1DM mouse model. For this purpose, pancreatic tissues were collected from control, STZ-induced T1DM and insulin-treated mice, and a pancreatic IMECs cell line (MS1) was cultured under control, 35 mM glucose with or without 10-8 M insulin conditions. Transmission and scanning electron microscopies were employed to evaluate the ultrastructure of the pancreatic islet microcirculation. We observed ultrastructural damage to IMECs and IMPCs in the type 1 diabetic group, as demonstrated by destruction of the cytoplasmic membrane and organelles (mainly mitochondria), and this damage was substantially reversed by insulin treatment. Furthermore, insulin inhibited collagenous fiber proliferation and alleviated edema of the widened pancreatic islet exocrine interface in T1DM mice.

The selected markers of endothelial lesions (sVCAM-1, sICAM-1, sE-SELECTIN, PAI-1, ADMA and RAGE) were assayed by the immunoenzymatic ELISA method. The study involved 66 patients (age: 5-18 years) with type 1 diabetes and 21 healthy controls (age: 5-16 years). In the type 1 diabetes patients, significantly higher concentrations of all of the assayed markers were observed compared to the healthy controls (<i>p</i> < 0.001). All of the evaluated markers positively correlated with the disease duration, the age, and BMI of the patients, while only PAI-1 and sE-SELECTIN were characteristic of linear correlations with the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). It can be concluded that endothelial inflammatory disease occurs in the early stages of type 1 diabetes mellitus in children. The correlations between PAI-1, sE-SELECTIN, and eGFR suggest an advantage of these markers over other markers of endothelial dysfunction as prognostic factors for kidney dysfunction in children with type 1 diabetes."

Thus, β-cell protection may be a primary target in the treatment of T1DM. Evidence has demonstrated that defective mitochondrial function plays an important role in pancreatic β-cell dysfunction and apoptosis; however, the fundamental effect of mitochondrial complex I action on β-cells and T1DM remains unclear. In the current study, the pancreas protective effect of complex I inhibitor rotenone (ROT) and its potential mechanism were assessed in a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced mouse model of T1DM and in cultured mouse pancreatic β-cell line, Min6. ROT treatment exerted a hypoglycemic effect, restored the insulin level, and decreased inflammation and cell apoptosis in the pancreas. In vitro experiments also showed that ROT decreased STZ- and inflammatory cytokines-induced β-cell apoptosis. These protective effects were accompanied by attenuation of reactive oxygen species, increased mitochondrial membrane potential, and upregulation of transcriptional coactivator PPARα coactivator 1α (PGC-1α)-controlled mitochondrial biogenesis. These findings suggest that mitochondrial complex I inhibition may represent a promising strategy for β-cell protection in T1DM."

Majority of T1DM patients who carried homozygous variant (TT) genotype of the PTPN22 gene had either DR3-DRB5 or DRB3-DRB4 genotypes. In T1DM patients who co-inherited the high risk HLA DQ, DR alleles with the variant genotype of PTPN22 gene, the majority were positive for three autoantibodies. Our data demonstrate that the variant T-allele of the PTPN22 gene along with HLA-DQ2 and DQ8 alleles constitute significant determinants of genetic predisposition of T1DM in Kuwaiti children."

This increase in CP indicates the possibility of pancreatic beta cell regeneration and/or increased function. The commonly accepted belief that individuals with T1DM quickly lose all function of pancreatic beta cells has led to academic consequences; many immunotherapy clinical trials' inclusion criteria require participants to have a new diagnosis of T1DM based on the assumption that those with a longer duration of diabetes have unrecoverable cessation of insulin secretion. CP could influence inflammation, microvascular circulation, and endothelial function. Further, it could affect the neuronal and glomerular structure and/or function. These potential functions of CP are seen by the correlation between measurable CP levels and decreased diabetic complication rates."

Objectives We aim to determine the prevalence of associated autoimmune diseases (Hashimoto's thyroiditis, celiac disease (CD), and adrenal insufficiency (AI)) and evaluate the most reporting symptoms and glycemic control assessment, as well as microvascular complications and hypoglycemia episodes. Methods A cross-sectional study of 251 patients with T1DM at the diabetic clinic of King Abdulaziz Medical City in Riyadh (KAMC-RD), Saudi Arabia, was conducted. Autoimmune serologies including thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibody and tissue transglutaminase IgA (tTG-IgA) antibody were checked with hormonal studies such as thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), morning serum cortisol, and short Synacthen test (SST) with duodenal biopsy results all were reviewed if present. Patients were directly interviewed to evaluate for the most common symptoms (including hypoglycemia episodes) for the preceding two weeks. Glycemic control was assessed by measuring glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). Microvascular complications (i.e., nephropathy and retinopathy) were estimated by looking at the urine albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) besides the ophthalmology's visit notes. Results The mean age was 26.3 ± 7.7 years, and the mean duration of diabetes at the time of data collection was 12.2 ± 7.6 years, whereas the mean HbA1c was 8.9% ± 1.8%. The prevalence of hypothyroidism was 16.3%, and TPO positivity was discovered in 58.6% of the tested patients (n = 70) with equal prevalence among both genders (p = 0.685). tTG-IgA were noticed among 16.4% of the patients (n = 164) without significant difference among gender. Serum cortisol test was performed among 128 patients; 28.1% had suboptimal levels, and 5.5% were deficient. Only four patients (n = 15) had suboptimal responses after SST. Nervousness and anxiety (p < 0.001), fatigue with weakness (p = 0.018), weight gain (p = 0.017), and cold intolerance (p = 0.005) were noted, which were statistically significantly higher among females. Weight gain was statistically significantly higher among the age group of >30 years (p = 0.036). For microvascular complication screening, ACR was collected in 199 (79.2%) participants, with a mean of 27.7 ± 155.9 mg/mmol. Only 10 (5%) patients had microalbuminuria, and 16 (8%) had macroalbuminuria; it was correlated significantly with diabetes duration (p = 0.045). A total of 132 (52.8%) patients were seen by ophthalmology, 28 (21.4%) had nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR), and 10 (7.6%) has proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) that significantly correlated with the duration of diabetes (p = 0.027). During patient interviews, 187 (74.5%) reported symptomatic hypoglycemia events that correlated significantly with glycemic control (p = 0.029). Conclusion Autoimmunity in Saudi adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus was significant with equal prevalence among both genders and age groups with no or slight difference. Clinical manifestations of autoimmunity were higher in women. Diabetes chronicity and poor glycemic control were the major complications; therefore, early glycemic control is advocated. Regular screening for autoimmunity and its complications is recommended for type 1 diabetic patients. Autoimmunity was found almost similar to previous literature."

It is associated with macrovascular and microvascular complications. Tight glycaemic control has been shown to ameliorate the long-term complications of T1DM, but this benefit has to be balanced with the risk and fear of hypoglycaemia. Monitoring glucose levels frequently helps patients to achieve more intensive glycaemic control. Finger prick blood glucose monitoring has traditionally been the most commonly used method to monitor glucose levels. More recently, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems, which measure interstitial glucose, have become available. CGM systems remove or significantly reduce the need for blood glucose testing and have been shown in real world and clinical trial settings to improve glycaemic control, reduce frequency of hypoglycaemia, improve recognition of hypoglycaemia and improve quality of life. The question now is whether CGM should replace capillary blood glucose measurements and be offered to all patients with T1DM."

Focus of the review is on the role of innate immune system, including activation of some signaling cascades, cytokine response, and activity of the Toll-like receptors in the development of T1D. Dysfunction of innate immunity is the cause of the attack of pancreatic beta cells by the host T-lymphocytes, which leads to the death of pancreatic beta cells that produce insulin. Lack of insulin causes hyperglycemia and the need for lifelong injections of insulin in patients with T1D, which, nevertheless, does not exclude damage to many organs and tissues, given particular vulnerability of the blood vessels under conditions of hyperglycemia. The review discusses the role of oxidative stress as a factor that plays a major role in damage of vascular system and pancreatic tissue during the development of T1D. Considering high sensitivity of pancreatic beta cells to the action of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the possibility of using antioxidants for reducing the level of pathological consequences in the course of T1D development is discussed. New information on anti-diabetic activity of the exogenous antioxidant enzyme peroxiredoxin 6, which is capable of penetrating cells, activating insulin production in beta cells, reducing ROS levels, as well as decreasing activation of some signaling cascades, production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and expression of Toll-like receptors in beta cells and in immune cells during T1D development is discussed."
31192721,"A Preliminary Study on ""PRISMA"" Education in Improving Self-Management and Level of Compliance in Children with Type-1 Diabetes Mellitus.",['PRISMA education'],"['Priska Emiliana', 'Nur Agustini', 'Yeni Rustina']","Children with Type-1 Diabetes Mellitus (TIDM) need long-term care that requires supervision. Without good management, there will be an increase in blood glucose, which can cause complications in organs and tissues. One way to improve self-management and level of compliance in blood glucose control is by providing education. This study aimed to determine the effect of PRISMA education on self-management and level of compliance in children with T1DM. This study used a quasi-experimental design with no control group. PRISMA education using animated videos was given to the respondents who filled out the questionnaire about self-management and level of compliance (pre-test) and were evaluated on the eighth day (post-test). The sample of this study consisted of 31 children in Jakarta, Bogor, Depok, and Tangerang. The results of this study indicate that PRISMA education had significant effects on self-management (<i>p</i> < 0.05) and level of compliance (<i>p</i> < 0.05). The delivery of self-management education in the form of animated videos could improve self-management and children's compliance in the management of diet, physical act, treatment, stress management and blood glucose control. Thus, this educational tool could be useful if it is integrated into nursing interventions, especially in the field of pediatric nursing."

The rapid development of bioinformatics and large-scale sequencing has led to the identification of functional circRNAs. Despite an overall upward trend, studies focusing on the roles of circRNAs in immune diseases remain relatively scarce. In the present study, we obtained a differential circRNA expression profile based on microarray analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in children with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). We characterized one differentially expressed circRNA back-spliced from the MYB Proto-Oncogene Like 2 (<i>MYBL2</i>) gene in patients with T1DM, termed as <i>hsa_circ_0060450</i>. Subsequent assays revealed that <i>hsa_circ_0060450</i> can serve as the sponge of miR-199a-5p, release its target gene, Src homology 2 (SH2)-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP2), encoded by the tyrosine-protein phosphatase non-receptor type 11 gene (<i>PTPN11</i>), and further suppress the JAK-STAT signaling pathway triggered by type I interferon (IFN-I) to inhibit macrophage-mediated inflammation, which indicates the important roles of circRNAs in T1DM and represents a promising therapeutic molecule in the treatment of T1DM."

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of stem cells transplantation (SCT) in patients with T1DM. We searched five literature databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, WanFang and CENTRAL) up to 31 October 2019. 29 studies (487 patients with T1DM) were included in our meta-analysis. There was no substantial publication bias. Meta-analysis showed the SCT had significant effect to decrease HbA1c (SMD, 1.40; 95% CI, 0.93 to 1.86; p < 0.00001; I<sup>2</sup> = 89%) and to improve C-peptide levels (SMD, -0.62; 95% CI, -1.22 to -0.02; p = 0.04; I<sup>2</sup> = 92%) at 1 year follow-up. Subgroup analyses showed the heterogeneity level of the results was high. Significant improvement of metabolic outcomes was observed in the subgroups of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) combined with hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and HSCs. The older age showed significant association with the efficacy in HSCs subgroup. The higher GADA positive rate before treatment also significantly associated with the decrease of daily insulin requirement. The transient insulin independence rate at last follow-up was 9.6 per 100 person-years (95% CI: 5.8-13.5%). The mean length of insulin independence was 15.6 months (95% CI: 12.3-18.9). The mortality of SCT was 3.4% (95% CI: 2.1-5.5%). Therefore, SCT is an efficacious and safe method for treating patients with T1DM especially in the subgroups of MSCs + HSCs and HSCs. Well designed, double blind and randomized controlled trails with large sample size and long-term follow-up are needed for further evaluation."

A few studies have suggested that minocycline that inhibits microglia may attenuate pain hypersensitivity in PDN. Moreover, a recent study reported that minocycline has an acute antidepressive-like effect in diabetic animals. Here we studied whether (i) prolonged minocycline treatment suppresses pain behaviour in PDN, (ii) the minocycline effect varies with submodality of pain, and (iii) the suppression of pain behaviour by prolonged minocycline treatment is associated with antidepressive-like effect. The experiments were performed in streptozotocin-induced rat model of type-1 diabetes. Pain behaviour was evoked by innocuous (monofilaments) and noxious (paw pressure) mechanical stimulation, innocuous cold (acetone drops) and noxious heat (radiant heat). Depression-like behaviour was assessed using forced swimming test. Minocycline treatment (daily 80mg/kg per os) of three-week duration started four weeks after induction of diabetes. Diabetes induced mechanical allodynia and hyperalgesia, cold allodynia, heat hypoalgesia, and depression-like behaviour. Minocycline treatment significantly attenuated mechanical allodynia and depression-like behaviour, while it failed to produce significant changes in mechanical hyperalgesia, cold allodynia or heat hypoalgesia. The results indicate that prolonged per oral treatment with minocycline has a sustained mechanical antiallodynic and antidepressive-like effect in PDN. These results support the proposal that minocycline might provide a treatment option for attenuating sensory and comorbid emotional symptoms in chronic PDN."

A random effects model was used to generate the summary risk estimates. The PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched to identify relevant observational studies. Twenty one observational studies were included in the present meta-analysis. Compared with offspring of mothers with normal weight, offspring of women with overweight or obesity were at an increased risk of developing childhood-onset T1DM (overweight: relative risk [RR] 1.09, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-1.15; obesity: RR 1.25, 95% CI, 1.16-1.34; per 5 kg m<sup>-2</sup> increase in BMI: RR 1.10, 95% CI, 1.06-1.13).

Pancreas and islet transplantation have emerged as promising treatments for reconstructing the normal regulation of blood glucose in T1DM patients. However, a critical shortage of pancreases and islets derived from human organ donors, complications associated with transplantations, high cost, and limited procedural availability remain bottlenecks in the widespread application of these strategies. Attempts have been directed to accommodate the increasing population of patients with T1DM. Stem cell therapy holds great potential for curing patients with T1DM. With the advent of research on stem cell therapy for various diseases, breakthroughs in stem cell-based therapy for T1DM have been reported.

Many studies have investigated polymorphisms in the <i>VDR</i> gene in association with T1DM in different populations, but there are still conflicting findings. This study aimed to evaluate the association of four variants in the <i>VDR</i> gene (rs7975232, rs1544410, rs731236, and rs2228570) with T1DM risk and vitamin D levels within a population from North Region, Brazil, as well as the influence of genomic ancestry on T1DM. A total of 65 T1DM patients and 83 non-T1DM patients were enrolled in this study. <i>VDR</i> gene polymorphisms were assessed using Sanger sequencing analysis. Genomic ancestry was analyzed using a set of 61 ancestry-informative markers. T1DM patients showed higher European genomic contribution and lower Native American genomic contribution when compared to non-T1DM patients. T1DM patients with AA genotype in rs1544410 or CC genotype in rs731236 had significantly lower 25(OH)D levels compared to the other two genotypes (<i>p</i> = 0.013 and <i>p</i> = 0.02, respectively), while T1DM with TT genotype in rs2228570 had higher 25(OH)D levels compared to CC + TC in the same polymorphism (<i>p</i> = 0.011). Our findings suggest that the association between 25(OH)D and T1DM may be modified by <i>VDR</i> variants, possibly influencing the development of this autoimmune disease."

N-Acetyl-Cysteine (NAC) is regarded as facilitating endothelial cell function and angiogenesis and may have treatment effect in the case of diabetes. However, the impact of NAC on T1DM are unknown. Here we reported that inflammatory pathogenesis of canine type 1 diabetes liver disease and the therapeutic effect of NAC combined with insulin. For this purpose, the model was established by intravenous injection of streptozotocin (20 mg/kg). Forty adult dogs were used and divided into 5 groups: control group, DM group, insulin treatment group, NAC combined with insulin therapy, and NAC group, while study lasted for 16 weeks. Results showed that the level of liver function enzyme activity were apparently increased in DM group, while the NAC with insulin treatment remarkable decreased liver function enzyme levels. Histopathology revealed that obvious changes in liver structure of all DM group, as evidenced by hepatocyte disorder and cellular swelling. Liver structure was evaluated by Periodic Acid Schiff (PAS) and Masson staining, the tissues appeared glycogen deposition and collagen deposition, indicating that DM aggravated liver injury. Compared with control group, the protein and mRNA expression of NLRP3, Caspase-1, ASC, and GSDMD were significantly induced in the DM group, while INS and NAC combined with INS treatment reversed the above changes. The levels of NF-κB P65, p-NF-κB, and IFN γ were availably enhanced in the DM group, which decreased through insulin and NAC combined with insulin treatment. This study demonstrated that NAC combined with INS exerted protective effects against STZ-induced liver injury by inhibiting the NLRP3/NF-κB pathway. The findings indicated that NAC combined with INS may serve as a potential candidate therapy for the treatment of T1DM."

To test a new visual analytics (VA) method with reduced complexity of OCT data analysis by comparing the layer thickness of children with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) to matched controls. <b>Methods</b>: OCT was performed on unilateral eyes of 26 children with T1DM without diabetic retinopathy and 29 healthy children to obtain macular volume scans. Subsequently, segmented inner retinal layers were analyzed using VA. Deviation maps were generated to readily visualize thickness differences between both groups and to investigate thickness changes of individual patients in relation to the control group. <b>Results</b>: In DevMs of the patient group, the total retina (TR) demonstrated localized, irregular areas of thinning (mean ± standard deviation) involving foveal center, inner macula, and inferior-nasal outer macula (-9.31 ± 1.73 µm; p < 0.05). Similarly, retinal nerve fiber layer showed continuous and localized areas of thinning in both inner and outer macula, extending nasally (-5.45 ± 4.31 µm; p < 0.05). In DevMs of individual patients, the TR and inner retinal layers revealed remarkable changes in thickness that were present between patients at both late and early stages of diabetes. <b>Conclusion</b>: The VA method simplifies the in-depth analysis of OCT volume data from different groups and is effective in detecting retinal thickness changes in children with diabetes. It can be easily adopted in a clinical set-up and intuitively used in complex multidisciplinary studies."

The present multicenter study was conducted in different hospitals in UAE including University Hospital Sharjah, Dubai Hospital and Rashid Hospital. A total of fifty-eight Emirati participants aged above 18 years and with a BMI < 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> were recruited and forty-five of these participants had a confirmed diagnosis of T1DM. Five groups of complications associated with the latter were identified including hyperlipidemia, neuropathy, ketoacidosis, hypothyroidism and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). A comprehensive whole transcriptomic analysis using NGS was conducted. The outcomes of the study revealed the common DEGs between T1DM without complications and T1DM with different complications. The results revealed seven common candidate DEGs, SPINK9, TRDN, PVRL4, MYO3A, PDLIM1, KIAA1614 and GRP were upregulated in T1DM complications with significant increase in expression of SPINK9 (Fold change: 5.28, 3.79, 5.20, 3.79, 5.20) and MYO3A (Fold change: 4.14, 6.11, 2.60, 4.33, 4.49) in hyperlipidemia, neuropathy, ketoacidosis, hypothyroidism and PCOS, respectively. In addition, functional pathways of ion transport, mineral absorption and cytosolic calcium concentration were involved in regulation of candidate upregulated genes related to neuropathy, ketoacidosis and PCOS, respectively.

Fulminant type 1 diabetes mellitus (FT1DM) is a clinical condition that is characterized by remarkably rapid and complete pancreatic β-cell destruction, rapid onset of hyperglycemic symptoms followed by ketoacidosis. In most cases this process takes a few days. Although rare, there have been clinical manifestations with a prolonged progress that lasts longer than one week. This study focused on the case of a 35-monthold boy who was referred to our clinic with the diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis, and later had a modest elevation in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels (6.7 %) incompatible with his significantly elevated blood glucose levels. The autoantibodies against pancreatic β-cells were negative. On the basis of these above mentioned findings, our patient was then diagnosed with fulminant type 1 diabetes mellitus. If patients with diabetic ketoacidosis have no elevation in HbA1c levels, they should be assessed for possible clinical factors that can lead to lower detectable levels of HbA1c.

The study subjects (n = 155) were recruited from among Japanese T1DM patients who visited the outpatient clinic of the Department of Pediatrics, Osaka City University Hospital. The study subjects experienced menarche during 1976-2020. They were divided into the menarche-post-T1DM group (n = 117) and the menarche-pre-T1DM group (n = 38), in whom menarche occurred after or before the diagnosis of T1DM, respectively. The time of birth was also stratified into five decade/time bins extending from 1960s to 2000s. The subjects filled a questionnaire on menarche. Other clinical information was obtained from the medical records. The median age at menarche was 12.5 years (11.3-13.4) (25<sup>th</sup>-75<sup>th</sup> percentile) for the menarche-post-T1DM group and 11.8 years (10.9-13.0) for the menarche-pre-T1DM group (p = 0.024).

Although most agree that T1DM-induced hyperglycemia is a risk factor for progressive bone loss, the mechanisms for the link between T1DM and bone loss still remain elusive. In this study, we found that bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) isolated from T1DM donors were less inducible for osteogenesis than those from non-T1DM donors and further identified a mechanism involving bone morphogenetic protein-6 (BMP6) that was produced significantly less in BMSCs derived from T1DM donors than that in control cells. With addition of exogenous BMP6 in culture, osteogenesis of BMSCs from T1DM donors was restored whereas the treatment of BMP6 seemed not to affect non-T1DM control cells. We also demonstrated that bone mineral density (BMD) was reduced in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice compared with that in control animals, and intraperitoneal injection of BMP6 mitigated bone loss and increased BMD in diabetic mice. Our results suggest that bone formation in T1DM patients is impaired by reduction of endogenous BMP6, and supplementation of BMP6 enhances osteogenesis of BMSCs to restore BMD in a mouse model of T1DM, which provides insight into the development of clinical treatments for T1DM-assocaited bone loss.

We determined whether albuminuria associates with alterations in the proteome of HDL (high-density lipoprotein) of subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus and whether those alterations associated with coronary artery calcification. Approach and Results- In a cross-sectional study of 191 subjects enrolled in the DCCT (Diabetes Control and Complications Trial)/EDIC study (Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications), we used isotope dilution tandem mass spectrometry to quantify 46 proteins in HDL. Stringent statistical analysis demonstrated that 8 proteins associated with albuminuria. Two of those proteins, AMBP (α1-microglobulin/bikunin precursor) and PTGDS (prostaglandin-H2 D-isomerase), strongly and positively associated with the albumin excretion rate ( P<10<sup>-6</sup>). Furthermore, PON (paraoxonase) 1 and PON3 levels in HDL strongly and negatively associated with the presence of coronary artery calcium, with odds ratios per 1-SD difference of 0.63 (95% CI, 0.43-0.92; P=0.018) for PON1 and 0.59 (95% CI, 0.40-0.87; P=0.0079) for PON3. Only 1 protein, PON1, associated with both albumin excretion rate and coronary artery calcification. Conclusions- Our observations indicate that the HDL proteome is remodeled in type 1 diabetes mellitus subjects with albuminuria. Moreover, low concentrations of the antiatherosclerotic protein PON1 in HDL associated with both albuminuria and coronary artery calcification, raising the possibility that alterations in HDL protein cargo mediate, in part, the known association of albuminuria with cardiovascular risk in type 1 diabetes mellitus.

The aim of this study was to evaluate hematologic indices indicating PLT activity in children with type 1 diabetes. This was a case-control study which was conducted on 166 inpatients in 17 Shahrivar children hospital, Rasht, Iran during April 2016 to April 2017. Cases and controls were 83 children with type 1 diabetes mellitus and 83 children hospitalized for thorough assessment of short stature, respectively. Groups were matched for age and sex. Demographic characteristics and hematologic variables were assessed. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to determine the normality of the distribution. Results for continuous and categorical variables were demonstrated as mean±SD and number and percent, respectively. Continuous variables without normal distribution were demonstrated as median (interquartile range). The χ/Fisher's exact test was used to compare categorical variables. The normal and non-normal distributed quantitative variables were respectively assessed by independent T-test or Mann-Whitney U test. P-value <0.05 noted statistical significance. The median (interquartile range) age of all children was 10 (6 to 13) years old. Thirty-five (42.2) of patients with diabetes and 35 (42.2) of control group were male individuals.

28429780,Insulin analogues in type 1 diabetes mellitus: getting better all the time.,[],"['Chantal Mathieu', 'Pieter Gillard', 'Katrien Benhalima']","The treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus consists of external replacement of the functions of β cells in an attempt to achieve blood levels of glucose as close to the normal range as possible. This approach means that glucose sensing needs to be replaced and levels of insulin need to mimic physiological insulin-action profiles, including basal coverage and changes around meals. Training and educating patients are crucial for the achievement of good glycaemic control, but having insulin preparations with action profiles that provide stable basal insulin coverage and appropriate mealtime insulin peaks helps people with type 1 diabetes mellitus to live active lives without sacrificing tight glycaemic control. Insulin analogues enable patients to achieve this goal, as some have fast action profiles, and some have very slow action profiles, which gives people with type 1 diabetes mellitus the tools to achieve dynamic insulin-action profiles that enable tight glycaemic control with a risk of hypoglycaemia that is lower than that with human short-acting and long-acting insulins.

Current research indicates that breast milk contains a variety of bioactive substances including immunoglobulins, oligosaccharides, insulin, lactoferrin, lysozyme, cytokines, epidermal growth factors, leukocytes, nucleotides, beneficial bacteria and vitamins. Such substances strengthen the breastfeeding infant's immune system, both directly, by increasing gut microbiota diversity and attacking harmful bacteria and pro-inflammatory molecules, and indirectly, by increasing thymus performance. Accordingly, a lack of or inadequate breastfeeding may predispose infants to several autoimmune disorders, including T1DM.

People with T1DM have a 2-6-fold higher risk of epilepsy than the general population. The onset of T1DM anticipates the onset of epilepsy by a mean period between 1,5 and 2,8 years. These two disorders share four potential distinct pathogenic factors: a) genetic predisposition; b) factors involved in autoimmune responses (i.e. anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies-GADAbs); c) effects of hypo/hyperglycaemia; d) cerebrovascular damages resulting in ischaemic processes. Seizures semiology prominently includes focal (up to patterns of epilepsia partialis continua) or secondarily generalized seizures but also reflex seizures and various forms of generalized seizures. EEG abnormalities are more common in people with an inappropriate metabolic control with a prominent involvement of fronto-temporal regions. Epilepsy management does not differ between patients with and without diabetes and insulin, nutritional recommendations and physical activity may also produce significant benefits on seizures control. Possible therapeutic alternatives in selected cases include immunosuppressive drugs (in patients with GADAbs) and ketogenic diet."

Bevezetés: Az 1-es típusú diabetes mellitus és a coeliakia gyakori társulása jól ismert. Néhány tanulmány beszámol átmeneti antitranszglutamináz-emelkedésről 1-es típusú diabeteses betegekben, akiknél az emelkedett antitestszint gluténmentes diéta bevezetése nélkül normalizálódik. Célkitűzés: Kutatásunk során az átmeneti antitranszglutamináz-emelkedés gyakoriságának meghatározását tűztük ki célul. További célunk volt a coeliakia gyakoriságának megállapítása 1-es típusú diabetesszel gondozott betegeink között. Módszer: A Semmelweis Egyetem I. Gyermekgyógyászati Klinikáján 1-es típusú diabetesszel gondozott betegeket vontuk be vizsgálatunkba (238 lány, 265 fiú, medián [IR] életkor az 1-es típusú diabetes diagnózisakor: 7,83 [4,67-11] év). Vizsgáltuk a jelenség időbeli megjelenését, az emelkedés mértékét, gyakoriságát és az antitest típusát. Leíró statisztikai módszereket és khi-négyzet-próbát alkalmaztunk. Eredmények: A vizsgált populációban a coeliakia gyakorisága 12,52%. Átmeneti antitranszglutamináztiter-emelkedést 48 gyermeknél (10,9%) észleltünk. Összesen 71-szer mértünk átmeneti antitranszglutamináz-emelkedést. A gyermekek közül 34 esetben (70,83%) egyszer fordult elő emelkedést mutató antitest, a többi betegnél 2-8 alkalommal. Gyakrabban tapasztaltunk izolált IgA-típusú emelkedést, mint izolált IgG-típusút (54 vs. 5). Következtetés: Az átmeneti antitranszglutamináz-emelkedés gyakorisága magas, összevethető a valódi coeliakiás csoporttal. Kutatásunk alátámasztja a nemzetközi ajánlást, miszerint mérsékelt mértékű antitranszglutamináz-emelkedés esetén, tünetmentes 1-es típusú diabetesszel gondozott betegben a gluténfogyasztás folytatása és az antitestszintek gyakori kontrollja javasolt.

Nevertheless, the results reported were inconsistent and had not been reviewed quantitatively. Accordingly, the quantitative meta-analysis which including VBM studies of patients with T1DM was conducted. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> The gray matter volume alterations in patients with T1DM was estimated by using the software seed-based d mapping. Meantime, the meta-regression was applied to detect the effects of some demographics and clinical characteristics. <b>Results:</b> Six studies were finally included, which with 6 datasets comprising 414 T1DM patients and 216 healthy controls. The pooled meta-analyses detected that patients with T1DM showed robustly increased gray matter volume in the left dorsolateral superior frontal gyrus and middle frontal gyrus and a decreased gray matter volume in the right lingual gyrus, cerebellum, precuneus, the left inferior temporal gyrus, and middle temporal gyrus. The meta-regression showed that the mean age, the female patient's ratio, duration of illness and HbAlc% for T1DM patients were not linearly related with gray matter alterations. <b>Conclusion:</b> This meta-analysis demonstrates that gray matter volume decreases in T1DM patients were mainly locates in the cortical regions and cerebellum."

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of C-peptide in renal and inflammatory complications in streptozotocin (STZ)-diabetic mice model of T1DM with kidney disease. The study was performed in 8-week old male C57BL/6 mice. Two streptozotocin-diabetic groups (a T1DM animal model), after 4 weeks of diabetes, were treated with subcutaneous infusion of either vehicle (n = 12) or C-peptide (n = 11). Two non-diabetic groups (vehicle, n = 10; C-peptide, n = 9) were treated using the same protocol as described for the diabetic mice. The treatment with C-peptide in the diabetic group reduced the urinary levels of IL17 and TNFα, as well as IL4 and IL10 (p < 0.05). Contrary, the diabetic + C-peptide group presented higher IL10 gene expression in kidney. Besides, it displayed a reduction of TNFα gene expression. The data suggest that C-peptide may modulate pro- and anti-inflammatory signalling pathways, resulting in attenuation of kidney inflammation in T1DM animal model."

Excess fat mass may impact bone density and ultimately fracture risk. We studied the interaction between bone and adipose tissue in type 1 diabetes subjects submitted to two different clinical managements: (I) conventional insulin therapy or (II) autologous nonmyeloablative hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (AHST). The study comprised 3 groups matched by age, gender, height and weight: control (C = 24), type 1 diabetes (T1D = 23) and type 1 diabetes treated with AHST (T1D-AHST = 9). Bone mineral density (BMD) and trabecular bone score (TBS) were assessed by dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). <sup>1</sup>H Magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to assess bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT) in the L3 vertebra, and abdominal magnetic resonance imaging was used to assess intrahepatic lipids (IHL), visceral (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT). Individuals conventionally treated for T1D were more likely to be overweight (C = 23.8 ± 3.7; T1D = 25.3 ± 3.4; T1D-AHST = 22.5 ± 2.2 Kg/m<sup>2</sup>; p > 0.05), but there was no excessive lipid accumulation in VAT or liver. Areal BMD of the three groups were similar at all sites; lumbar spine TBS (L3) was lower in type 1 diabetes (p < 0.05). Neither SAT nor VAT had any association with bone parameters. Bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT) lipid profiles were similar among groups. BMAT saturated lipids were associated with cholesterol, whereas unsaturated lipids had an association with IGF1. Overweight and normal weight subjects with type 1 diabetes have normal areal bone density, but lower trabecular bone scores. Adipose distribution is normal and BMAT volume is similar to controls, irrespective of clinical treatment."

Likewise, T1DM results in pathological bone loss and increased risk of fracture. Thus, we quantified the density of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP<sup>+</sup>) sensory and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH<sup>+</sup>) sympathetic nerve fibers and determined the association between the innervation density and microarchitecture of trabecular bone at the mouse femoral neck. Ten weeks-old female mice received 5 daily administrations of streptozocin (i.p. 50mg/kg) or citrate (control group). Twenty weeks later, femurs were analyzed by microCT and processed for immunohistochemistry. Confocal microscopy analysis revealed that mice with T1DM had a significant loss of both CGRP<sup>+</sup> and TH<sup>+</sup> nerve fibers in the bone marrow at the femoral neck. Likewise, microCT analysis revealed a significant decrease in the trabecular bone mineral density (tBMD), bone volume/total volume ratio (BV/TB), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), trabecular number (Tb.N) and trabecular separation (Tb.Sp) in mice with T1DM as compared to control mice. Analysis of correlation revealed a positive and significant association between density of CGRP<sup>+</sup> or TH<sup>+</sup> nerve fibers with tBMD, BV/TV, Tb.Th and Tb.Sp, but not with trabecular number (there was a positive association only for CGRP<sup>+</sup>) and degree of anisotropy (DA). This study suggests an interaction between sensory and sympathetic nervous system and T1DM-induced bone loss. Identification of the factors involved in the loss of CGRP<sup>+</sup> sensory and TH<sup>+</sup> sympathetic fibers and how they regulate bone loss may result in new avenues to treat T1DM-related osteoporosis."

Sodium-glucose cotransporter inhibitors reduce glucose reabsorption in the kidneys, which lowers blood glucose. In addition, they offer significant cardiovascular benefits and renal protection. Multiple phase III trials of sodium-glucose cotransporter inhibitors in patients with type 1 diabetes have been completed. The European Medicines Agency approved dapagliflozin as an adjuvant therapy to insulin for patients with type 1 diabetes who have poor blood glucose control with the optimal dose of insulin alone (body mass index ≥ 27 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). As adjuvants to insulin for patients with type 1 diabetes, sodium-glucose cotransporter inhibitors improve blood glucose control and reduce total daily insulin dose and body weight.

Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), patients have an increased risk of psychiatric morbidity compared to their healthy counterparts. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the demographic and laboratory data and psychological characteristics of children with T1DM from two geographical regions of Turkey. The study included 98 pediatric T1DM patients followed in pediatric endocrinology clinics from Diyarbakir (n=50), an eastern city and Antalya (n=48) a western city, and 43 healthy subjects from Diyarbakir (n=20) and Antalya (n=23). The sociodemographic data, duration of diabetes and the glycated hemoglobin levels (HbA1c) were also noted. For the evaluation of emotional and behavioral problems in children, Turkish version of The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) 6-18, and for depression, Child depression inventory (CDI) was used. Patients from the Diyarbakır Diabetes Mellitus (DDM) group had a longer duration of diabetes compared to those of the Antalya Diabetes Mellitus (ADM) group, while HbA1c levels were not statistically different. Children with T1DM from Diyarbakır reported higher problem scores in CBCL in majority of domains and both internalizing and externalizing subscores compared to the controls and in all domains compared to the patients from Antalya. The CDI scores of the DDM group were also significantly higher than those of the ADM group. In conclusion, diabetic children from Diyarbakır had more problems in emotional, social and behavioral domains compared to the healthy peers and patients from Antalya, indicating that T1DM brought more psychosocial burden to these patients independently from the metabolic control. Pediatric specialists working in the eastern region should be more precautious with diabetic patients in terms of comorbid psychiatric conditions and psychiatric referral when needed."

Recently, several researchers have reported that combined aerobic and resistance exercise prevents hypoglycemia during and after exercise. Furthermore, exercise has been shown to have beneficial effects on the psychological status of patients with various diseases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of combined aerobic and resistance exercise in adolescents with T1DM. Methods Thirty-five type 1 diabetic patients were enrolled, and subjects were divided into either an exercise group or a control group. Thirty patients (20 patients in the exercise group, 10 patients in the control group) completed the study. The exercise program was performed for 1 h at a time, once a week, for 12 weeks. Study parameters were evaluated at baseline and 3 months after baseline evaluation. Results Combined aerobic and resistance exercise better controlled the body mass index (BMI), and also improved maximum muscular strength and maximum exercise intensity. On psychological tests, subjects' attention and quality of life showed improving tendency, while their stress and behavioral problems diminished. The number of exercise events increased in the training group, while the daily total insulin dose and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level showed no significant changes. Conclusions A 12-week structured exercise program consisting of aerobic and resistance exercises improves cardiovascular, neurocognitive and psychobehavioral functions, and positively helps lifestyle modification in patients with T1DM."

T1D is accompanied by DNA damage, oxidative stress, and inflammation, although there is still scarce information about the oxidative stress response and DNA repair in T1D pathogenesis. We used the microarray method to assess mRNA expression profiles in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 19 T1D patients compared to 11 controls and identify mRNA targets of microRNAs that were previously reported for T1D patients. We found 277 differentially expressed genes (220 upregulated and 57 downregulated) in T1D patients compared to controls. Analysis by gene sets (GSA and GSEA) showed an upregulation of processes linked to ROS generation, oxidative stress, inflammation, cell death, ER stress, and DNA repair in T1D patients. Besides, genes related to oxidative stress responses and DNA repair (<i>PTGS2</i>, <i>ATF3</i>, <i>FOSB</i>, <i>DUSP1</i>, and <i>TNFAIP3</i>) were found to be targets of four microRNAs (hsa-miR-101, hsa-miR148a, hsa-miR-27b, and hsa-miR-424). The expression levels of these mRNAs and microRNAs were confirmed by qRT-PCR. Therefore, the present study on differential expression profiles indicates relevant biological functions related to oxidative stress response, DNA repair, inflammation, and apoptosis in PBMCs of T1D patients relative to controls. We also report new insights regarding microRNA-mRNA interactions, which may play important roles in the T1D pathogenesis."

Poor glycaemic control and consequent increased HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels are major risk factors for the development of vascular complications. HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels are the main focus of current management strategies; however, the recommended target is rarely achieved in adolescents. Thus, a clear need exists for improved biomarkers to identify high-risk young people early and to develop new intervention strategies. Evidence is accumulating that early increases in urinary albumin excretion could be predictive of adolescents with T1DM who are at an increased risk of developing vascular complications, independent of HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels. These findings present an opportunity to move towards the personalized care of adolescents with T1DM, which takes into consideration changes in albumin excretion and other risk factors in addition to HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels."

She presented with marked hyperglycaemia (56 mmol/L) without significant ketonaemia (2.6 mmol/L) and serum hyperosmolality (426 mOsm/kg). Managing her profound hypernatraemic (>180 mmol/L) dehydration was challenging but resulted in good outcome. Paediatric patients with HHS will likely be treated with the diabetes ketoacidosis (DKA) protocol because of perceived rarity of HHS leading to inadequate rehydration and risk of vascular collapse. Hence, emphasis on the differences in the management protocols of DKA and HHS is paramount. Prompt recognition and adequate management are crucial to avert complications. The undesirable rate of decline of hypernatraemia due to the use of hypotonic fluid was captured in this case. We describe the pivotal role of liberal fluid therapy with non-hypotonic fluids."

This study aimed to investigate the potential protective effects of pioglitazone (Pio) and curcumin (Cur) against DCM in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), with pointing to their role on Ca<sup>+2</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) expression. Diabetes was induced in adult male Sprague Dawley rats by administration of single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ) (52.5 mg/kg). Diabetic rats were administered either Pio (20 mg/kg/day) or Cur (100 mg/kg/day) orally for 6 weeks. Treatment with Pio and/or Cur markedly reduced serum cardiac injury markers and lipid profile markers in diabetic animals. Additionally, Pio and/or Cur treatment mitigated oxidative stress and fibrosis in diabetic rats as evident from the significant suppression in myocardial lipid peroxidation and tumor growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) level, with concomitant significant elevation in total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and improvement in histopathological architecture of heart tissue. Pio/Cur treatment protocol accomplished its cardioprotective effect by depressing cardiac CaMKII/NF-κB signaling accompanied by enhancement in PPAR-γ expression. Conclusively, these findings demonstrated the therapeutic potential of Pio/Cur regimen in alleviating DCM in T1DM through modulation of CaMKII and PPAR-γ expression. Graphical Abstract."

Here, we report a case of diabetic ketoacidosis in a 63-year-old man with no history of hyperglycemia. The patient was diagnosed with FT1DM and had almost no insulin secretion. We examined his insulin and glucagon secretions induced by a liquid meal test at the onset of FT1DM and 1 year later. The results suggested severely attenuated insulin secretion and an undetectable level of serum insulin 1 year after onset. In contrast, glucagon secretion, which was highly impaired at onset, increased in response to food intake. Although previous reports have suggested that both β- and α-cells of pancreatic islets are damaged in patients with FT1DM, the number of α-cells may increase over time after the onset of FT1DM."

Diabetes was induced in Balb/c mice by i. p. injection of 55 mg/kg streptozotocin (STZ) for five consecutive days. The control group received vehicles. RES or (RES + STZ) groups received RES (50 mg/kg, i. p.) daily for 12 days starting from the fourth day of buffer or STZ injections, respectively. Blood glucose, serum insulin, beta cell mass, serum lipid profiles, histological changes, oxidative stress biomarkers were determined. Moreover, CXCL16, TF, ox-LDL, P62 and LC3 tissue expression were also analyzed. Diabetic mice showed a marked deterioration in biochemical, physical and oxidative stress parameters. Interestingly, immunofluorescence analysis showed a remarkable elevation in CXCL16 (12 folds), ox-LDL (9 folds), TF (8.3 folds) in pancreatic B-cells. Moreover, western blotting revealed a profound increase in ox-LDL (2.6 folds), TF (3.2 folds), while a significant decline in P62 (0.34) and LC3 (0.25) when compared to control. RES mitigated biochemical, physical, oxidative imbalance and distorted pancreatic architecture in T1DM mice. Intriguingly, CXCL16, ox-LDL, TF and autophagic markers were also restored after RES treatment. Our data give the first direct evidence that beta cell-specific CXCL16/ox-LDL pathway activation is a potential trigger of TF activation and autophagic beta cell death in T1DM. Moreover, RES may have potential therapeutic applications for prevention of T1DM mainly via ameliorating this pathway."

We report a 45-year-old male with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) treated with insulin analogues suffering from recurrent hypoglycemic coma and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). His symptoms were caused by exogenous insulin and were similar to IAS. A possible reason was that exogenous insulin induced IA. IA titers were 61.95% (normal: < 5%), and the concentrations of insulin and C-peptide were > 300 mU/L and < 0.02 nmol/L when hypoglycemia occurred. Based on his clinical symptoms and other examinations, he was diagnosed with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia caused by IA.

High glycemic fluctuations increase metabolic stress in the type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) heart. There is a lack of understanding on how metabolites and genes affect metabolic remodeling in the T1DM heart. We hypothesize that differential expression of metabolic genes and metabolites synergistically influence metabolic remodeling preceding T1DM cardiomyopathy. To test our hypothesis, we conducted high throughput analysis of hearts from adult male hyperglycemic <i>Ins2</i><sup>+/-</sup> (Akita) and littermate normoglycemic <i>Ins2</i><sup>+/+</sup> (WT) mice. The Akita mouse is a spontaneous, genetic model of T1DM that develops increased levels of consistent glycemic variability without the off-target cardiotoxic effects present in chemically- induced models of T1DM. After validating the presence of a T1DM phenotype, we conducted metabolomics via LC-MS analysis and genomics via next-generation sequencing in left ventricle tissue from the Akita heart. Ingenuity Pathway Analyses revealed that 108 and 30 metabolic pathways were disrupted within the metabolomics and genomics datasets, respectively. Notably, a comparison between the two analyses showed 15 commonly disrupted pathways, including ketogenesis, ketolysis, cholesterol biosynthesis, acetyl CoA hydrolysis, and fatty acid biosynthesis and beta-oxidation. These identified metabolic pathways predicted by the differential expression of metabolites and genes provide the foundation for understanding metabolic remodeling in the T1DM heart. By limited experiment, we revealed a predicted disruption in the metabolites and genes behind T1DM cardiac metabolic derangement. Future studies targeting these genes and metabolites will unravel novel therapies to prevent/improve metabolic remodeling in the T1DM heart."

The patient developed sudden cardiac arrest following continuous insulin administration. Laboratory data revealed severe hypokalaemia. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed immediately for 63 minutes. Although his spontaneous circulation resumed, the haemodynamics remained unstable. Peripheral extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was therefore employed for mechanical circulatory support. Echocardiography under these conditions revealed generalised hypokinesia of the bilateral ventricles. The left ventricular ejection fraction was only 10-15%. The chest film revealed bilateral pulmonary congestion. The patient developed multiple organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury, liver congestion and persistent pulmonary oedema, although the hypokalaemia resolved. A temporary bilateral ventricular assist device (Bi-VAD) was used for superior systemic perfusion and unloading of the bilateral ventricles after 16 hours of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support. After the start of maintenance using the Bi-VAD, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was discontinued and the inotropic agents were tapered down immediately. Subsequently, the haemodynamics stabilised. All the visceral organs were well perfused with Bi-VAD support. Subsequent echocardiography demonstrated recovery from the myocardial stunning, with the left ventricular ejection fraction returning to 50-60%. The Bi-VAD was gradually weaned and successfully removed 12 days after implantation. The patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged without organ injury.

Herein, the functions of the islets are rapidly destroyed. Its pathogenesis is related to viral infection. Most people have been infected with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and many people have also suffered from drug hypersensitivity, however, few cases of FT1DM which were caused by both of the two conditions have been reported. Thus, below, we describe one such valuable case. <b>Case Summary:</b> The plasma glucose levels of a 73-year-old man diagnosed with drug-induced dermatitis showed a sudden increase (42 mmol/L) during methylprednisolone therapy. The urine ketone test was positive. The glycated hemoglobin level was 7%, endogenous insulin secretion decreased significantly, and the islet-related autoantibodies were negative. The patient was diagnosed with FT1DM. The lymphocyte EBV-DNA showed high copies numbers. The general condition of the patient improved after symptomatic treatment with insulin. However, the systemic allergic reaction aggravated after the use of iodinated contrast agents, prednisone, and thymic pentapeptide. The re-test for EBV-DNA showed significantly high relative levels, thus indicating the presence of EBV infection. We think that drug hypersensitivity and EBV infection together led to FT1DM in this case. After an indication for multiple daily insulin therapy, the patient's blood glucose was quickly controlled and he was discharged on the 38th-day post-admission. <b>Conclusion:</b> FT1DM is a rare case, however, drug hypersensitivity and EBV infection are not rare in the population. This is a rare case of FT1DM caused by drug hypersensitivity reaction and EBV infection. Through this case report, we emphasize the importance of the relationship between drug hypersensitivity, EBV infection and FT1DM and vigilance for the occurrence of FT1DM among hypersensitive individuals in clinical practice."

In addition, we aimed to examine risk factors known to be associated with future glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels in children diagnosed with T1DM. Methods This is a retrospective cohort study of 85 patients diagnosed with T1DM at toddler age (group 1; 0-2.9 years; n = 36) or preschool/school age (group 2; 5-6.9 years; n = 49) who were followed up at the University Children's Hospital in Zurich for at least 10 consecutive years or until the age of 15 years. Results The mean HbA1c level in the first year after diagnosis had a highly predictive value about glycemic control in the following 6 years. In addition, a longer duration of T1DM was associated with higher HbA1c values. HbA1c values did not differ significantly within 11 years after diagnosis between children in the two age groups. Neither was a difference found when comparing the two groups in respect to their chronological age, although a trend was noted (p = 0.09). This trend is very likely due to a longer duration of diabetes in group 1. Conclusions HbA1c level in the first year predicts glycemic control for the next 6 years and deterioration of HbA1c values can be noted with longer duration of T1DM. Moreover, our study demonstrated similar future glycemic control in patients diagnosed with T1DM at toddler age and preschool/school age."

The original aim was to provide isolated cells with an immune-protective shield, to prevent physical contact between the transplanted cells and the host's immune system, with retention of the microcapsules' biocompatibility and physical-chemical properties over time. In particular, this revolutionary approach essentially applied to islet grafts, in diabetic recipients who are not immunosuppressed, at a preclinical (rodents) and, subsequently, clinical level. Among the different chemistries potentially suitable for microencapsulation of live cells, alginic acid-based polymers, originally proposed by Sun, proved to be superior to all others in the following decades. In fact, only alginic acid-based microcapsules, containing allogeneic islets, ultimately entered pilot human clinical trials in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, as immuno-selectiveness and biocompatibility of alginic acid-hydrogels were never matched by other biopolymers. With problems related to human islet procurement coming into a sharper focus, in conjunction with technical limits of the encapsulated islet grafting procedures, new challenges are actually being pursued, with special regard to developing both new cellular systems - able to release immunomodulatory molecules and insulin itself - and new microencapsulation methods, with the use of novel polymeric formulations, under actual scrutiny. The use of embryonic and adult stem cells, within microcapsules, should address the restricted availability of cadaveric human donor-derived islets, whereas a new generation of newly-engineered microcapsules could better fulfill issues with graft site and long-term retention of biopolymer properties."

The aim of the study is to evaluate the dental caries, salivary flow rate, buffer capacity, and Lactobacilli in saliva in children with type 1 diabetes mellitus compared to the control group. <i>Methods.</i> The sample consisted of 160 children of 10 to 15 years divided into two groups: 80 children with type 1 diabetes mellitus and 80 children as a control group. Dental caries was assessed using the DMFT index for permanent dentition. Stimulated saliva was collected among all children. Salivary flow rate and buffer capacity were measured, and the colonies of <i>Lactobacillus</i> in saliva were determined. The observed children have answered a number of questions related to their dental visits and parents' education. The data obtained from each group were compared statistically using the chi-square test and Mann-Whitney <i>U</i>-test. The significant level was set at <i>p</i> < 0.05. <i>Results</i>. DMFT in children with type 1 diabetes was significantly higher than that in the control group (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Diabetic children have a low level of stimulated salivary flow rate compared to control children (0.86 ± 0.16 and 1.10 ± 0.14). The buffer capacity showed statistically significant differences between children with type 1 diabetes and control group (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Also, children with type 1 diabetes had a higher count and a higher risk of <i>Lactobacillus</i> compared to the control group (<i>p</i> < 0.05 and <i>p</i> < 0.001). <i>Conclusion</i>. The findings we obtained showed that type 1 diabetes mellitus has an important part in children's oral health. It appears that children with type 1 diabetes are exposed to a higher risk for caries and oral health than nondiabetic children."

This study determines how nutritional patterns influence the quality of dietary intervention with a 30% or 50% carbohydrate diet in terms of glycaemic control measured with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). Eating habits were obtained with a frequency-of-consumption questionnaire (FFQ-6) before the diet assessment. Altogether, we collected CGM and FFQ-6 data from 30 children (16 boys and 14 girls aged 10-17 years) with T1DM subjected to two consecutive 3-day nutritional plans. From these, 23 patients met the CGM data quality criteria for further analysis. Furthermore, high accuracy achieved in training (95.65%) and V-fold cross-validation (81.67%) suggest a significant impact of food habits in response to introduced nutritional changes. Patients who consumed more vegetables or grains (>4 times per day), more wheat products (>once per day), fewer fats (<1.5 times per day), and ranked fruit juice as the most common selection in the drinks category achieved glycaemic control more often after the introduction of a 30% carbohydrate diet, as opposed to those with different dietary patterns, whose glycaemic control was negatively impacted after switching to this diet.

This study aimed to determine the effects of troxerutin on cognitive deficits and glutamate cysteine ligase subunits (GCLM and GCLC) in the hippocampus of streptozotocin-induced type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) rats. At 12weeks after streptozotocin injection, T1DM rats were randomly divided into 4 groups (n=15 each group) to receive no treatment (T1DM), saline (T1DM+saline), alpha-lipoic acid (T1DM+alpha-lipoic acid), and troxerutin (T1DM+troxerutin), respectively, for 6weeks. Meanwhile, 10 control animals (NC group) were assessed in parallel. Learning performance was evaluated by the Morris water maze. After treatment, hippocampi were collected for pathological examination by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. Next, hippocampal superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) levels were assessed. Finally, glutamate cysteine ligase catalytic (GCLC) and glutamate cysteine ligase modifier (GCLM) subunit mRNA and protein levels were quantified by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot, respectively. Compared with T1DM and T1DM+saline groups, escape latency was overtly reduced in T1DM+alpha-lipoic acid and T1DM+troxerutin groups. Significantly increased GCLM and GCLC mRNA levels, GCLC protein amounts, SOD activity, and GSH levels, and reduced MDA amounts were observed in T1DM+alpha-lipoic acid and T1DM+troxerutin groups. In T1DM and T1DM+saline groups, H&E staining showed less pyramidal cells in the hippocampus, with disorganized layers, karyopyknosis, decreased endochylema, and cavitation, effects relieved in T1DM+alpha-lipoic acid and T1DM+troxerutin groups.

In this article, we describe a beneficial effect of peroxiredoxin 6 (PRDX6) in a type 1 diabetes mouse model. The main idea of this study was based on the well-known data that oxidative stress plays an important role in pathogenesis of diabetes and its associated complications. We hypothesised that PRDX6, which is well known for its various biological functions, including antioxidant activity, may provide an antidiabetic effect. It was shown that PRDX6 prevented hyperglycemia, lowered the mortality rate, restored the plasma cytokine profile, reversed the splenic cell apoptosis, and reduced the <i>β</i> cell destruction in Langerhans islets in mice with a severe form of alloxan-induced diabetes. In addition, PRDX6 protected rat insulinoma RIN-m5F <i>β</i> cells, cultured with TNF-<i>α</i> and IL-1<i>β</i>, against the cytokine-induced cytotoxicity and reduced the apoptotic cell death and production of ROS. Signal transduction studies showed that PRDX6 prevented the activation of NF-<i>κ</i>B and c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling cascades in RIN-m5F <i>β</i> cells cultured with cytokines.

The search for new therapeutic agents effective in alleviating the psychiatric condition associated with T1DM becomes critical. Using an animal model of T1DM, we aimed to evaluate the effect of a specific specialized pro-resolving lipid mediator Resolvin D5 (RvD5), in preventing behaviors related to depression and anxiety, investigating its influence on inflammasome in interleukin (IL)-1β in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. After experimental T1DM induction with streptozotocin (60 mg/kg, i.p.), these animals were treated for 23 days and randomly divided into 6 subgroups according to the treatment: vehicle (VEH), the antidepressant Fluoxetine (FLX; 10 mg/kg), the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory Ibuprofen (IBU; 30 mg/kg) or Resolvin D5 (RvD5; 1 3, or 10 ng/animal). As a control group for the experimental-T1DM condition, a group of normoglycemic animals treated with VEH underwent the same behavioral tests: elevated plus maze, open field, and modified forced swimming tests. In the end, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex samples were processed to analyze the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β levels. Our data showed that RvD5 treatment prevented the more pronounced anxious-like and reduced the depressive-like behaviors of experimental-T1DM animals and significantly improved the plasma glucose levels. Additionally, RvD5 treatment prevented the increased level of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of experimental-T1DM rats. To conclude, RvD5 presents a preventive therapeutic potential in impairing the development of the emotional complications resulting from T1DM. This potential may be related to its protective profile, as demonstrated in this study by its pro-resolutive action on neuroinflammation in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex."

In this study, we found that knockout of conventional protein kinase C (cPKC)γ significantly increased the phosphorylation of Tau at Ser214 and neurofibrillary tangles, but did not affect the activities of GSK-3β and PP2A in the hippocampal neurons of T1DM mice. cPKCγ deficiency significantly decreased the level of autophagy in the hippocampal neurons of T1DM mice. Activation of autophagy greatly alleviated the cognitive impairment induced by cPKCγ deficiency in T1DM mice. Moreover, cPKCγ deficiency reduced the AMPK phosphorylation levels and increased the phosphorylation levels of mTOR in vivo and in vitro. The high glucose-induced Tau phosphorylation at Ser214 was further increased by the autophagy inhibitor and was significantly decreased by an mTOR inhibitor. In conclusion, these results indicated that cPKCγ promotes autophagy through the AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway, thus reducing the level of phosphorylated Tau at Ser214 and neurofibrillary tangles."

As well as affecting adults, T1D is one of the most prevalent chronic childhood disorders. Several lines of evidence point to dysregulation of both cellular and humoral immune responses in this disorder. Several genetic loci have been associated with risk of T1D, implying the presence of a complex multifactorial pattern of inheritance for this disorder. Moreover, recent studies have reported dysregulation of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) in animal models of T1D or clinical samples. Several immune-related molecules and pathways such as NF-κB, PI3K/Akt/FOXO, JAK, MAPK, mTOR and STAT pathways are regulated by non-coding RNAs in the context of T1D. Improved understanding of the role of lncRNAs and miRNAs in the pathogenesis of T1D would facilitate design of preventive therapeutic modalities.

Vitamin D is a fat-soluble sterol derivative that not only participates in calcium and phosphorus metabolism but also acts as an immunomodulatory role by binding to nuclear vitamin D receptors to regulate the expression of transcription factors. Increasing evidence has shown that vitamin D has immunoregulation and anti-inflammatory effects, and it may play a role in T cell regulatory responses due to downregulation in the expression of cathepsin G and inhibition of CD4+ T cell activation and protection of <i>β</i> cells from immune attack and is beneficial in decreasing oxidative stress in T1DM patients. Epidemiologic evidence demonstrates involvement of vitamin D deficiency in T1DM pathogenesis, with the immune system improperly targeting and destroying its own islet <i>β</i> cells. In addition, polymorphisms in genes critical for vitamin D metabolism may increase the risk of islet autoimmunity and T1DM. In this paper, the relationship between vitamin D deficiency and the molecular mechanism of T1DM was discussed."

Their roles in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) pathogenesis are elusive. Here, the important role of circRNAs in T1DM was explored. circRNA profiling was performed for isolated CD4+ T cells from blood of T1DM and healthy volunteers. There were 257 differentially expressed circRNAs. Only three upregulated DEcircRNAs (hsa_circ_0000324, hsa_circ_0001853, and hsa_circ_0068797) were consistent with the GEO database. Through KEGG analyses, it was found that the three DEcircRNAs were associated with 11 miRNAs and 8 immune-related target genes (mRNA). Further analysis found that four miRNAs, two circRNAs, and four mRNAs were associated with nine circRNA-miRNA-mRNA networks. This confirmed the requirements of sponge mechanisms. The qRT-PCR analysis revealed that circRNA000324/miRNA675-5p/MAPK14 and circRNA000324/miRNA-675-5p/SYK may be potential mechanisms in regulation of differentiation and proliferation of CD4+ T cell in patients with T1DM.

Although enteroviruses are primarily involved in acute and lytic infections in vitro and in vivo, they can also establish a persistent infection. Prospective epidemiological studies have strongly associated the persistence of enteroviruses, especially coxsackievirus B (CVB), with the appearance of islet autoantibodies and an increased risk of T1DM. CVB can persist in pancreatic ductal and β-cells, which leads to structural or functional alterations of these cells, and to a chronic inflammatory response that promotes recruitment and activation of pre-existing autoreactive T cells and β-cell autoimmune destruction. CVB persistence in other sites, such as the intestine, blood cells and thymus, has been described; these sites could serve as a reservoir for infection or reinfection of the pancreas, and this persistence could have a role in the disturbance of tolerance to β-cells.

Data were collected in seven individual waves from countries in Asia, Africa, East Europe, and Latin America. Wave 7 was conducted from 2016 to 2017 and the African cohort included 12 countries. Questionnaires were administered to clinicians and patients. Analyses were mainly descriptive. Logistic regressions were performed to identify predictive factors for glycaemic control.A total of 788 patients were enrolled in the study.

TBR was significantly lower during Time 3 (1%) both compared with Time 1 and Time 2 (2%). A meaningful variance in TIR at Time 3 between individuals who performed or not PA during quarantine and a significant increase in TIR between Time 2 and Time 3 in individuals both doing PA at baseline and during quarantine was found. At logistic regression, only the presence of PA during quarantine significantly predicted a TIR >70%. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> Glycemic control of T1DM in adolescents using HCL system did not worsen during the restrictions due to COVID-19 pandemics and further improved in those who continued PA during the quarantine. Maintaining regular PA in a safe home environment is an essential strategy for young individuals with T1DM during the COVID-19 crisis."

However, the sole presenting feature of Mauriac syndrome can be hepatic glycogenosis in both adults and children. The mainstay of treatment for hepatic glycogenosis is strict control of glucose levels, with an excellent prognosis with improved glycaemic control. The authors present the case of a 22-year-old female patient with type 1 diabetes mellitus and a history of poor glycaemic control who was admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). She complained of episodes of right upper quadrant abdominal pain associated with nausea and vomiting for the last 2 months with worsening in the last 48 hours. Physical examination was remarkable for short stature and tenderness over the hepatic area with a mildly enlarged liver. The patient had elevated liver enzymes and persistent hyperlactacidaemia despite DKA resolution. Liver imaging suggested diffuse fat infiltration. The clinical suspicion of hepatic glycogenosis was confirmed by liver biopsy. After glycaemic control was improved, liver enzymes normalized and the episodes of abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting subsided."

The TNFa gene is subject of epigenetic regulation in which folate and homocysteine are important molecules because they participate in the methionine cycle where the most important methyl group donor (S-adenosylmethionine) is formed. We investigated whether TNFa gene promoter methylation status in T1D patients was related to blood folate, homocysteine and TNF-α in a transversal case-control study. We studied T1D patients (n 25, mean=13·7 years) and healthy control subjects (n 25, mean=31·1 years), without T1D and/or other autoimmune diseases or direct family history of these diseases. A blood sample was obtained for determination of serum folate, plasma homocysteine and TNF-α concentrations. Whole blood was used for the extraction of DNA to determine the percentage of methylation by real-time PCR and melting-curve analysis. Results are expressed as means and standard deviations for parametric variables and as median (interquartile range) for non-parametric variables. T1D patients showed a higher TNFa gene promoter methylation (39·2 (sd 19·5) %) when compared with control subjects (25·4 (sd 13·7) %) (P=0·008). TNFa gene promoter methylation was positively associated only with homocysteine levels in T1D patients (r 0·55, P=0·007), but not in control subjects (r -0·122, P=0·872).

Treatment includes diet, physical activity, insulin medication, and proper self-control. This self-control may be difficult, resulting in children, adolescents and their families suffering diverse psychosocial complications. There is an inverse relationship between self-control and psychosocial complications, the main problems being anxiety and depression, where adolescents are 2.3 times more likely to have mental health problems. Families are initially affected, in the debut period by a state of shock, with feelings of distress and anger. The necesary changes in habits and lifestyles can lead to psychosocial problems, including anxiety, depression and eating disorders. Subsequently, the child or adolescent and his or her family group may move into new balance characterized by good self-control and adherence to tratment, or deepen individual and group disorders which may reappear, especially in adolescence.

This obligate intracellular parasite can infect and replicate inside any nucleated cells including those of pancreas. Insulin is a hormone secreted by the pancreas and is responsible for controlling blood glucose concentration. Deficiency of insulin production accounts for the occurrence of type-1 diabetes mellitus (T1D). Thus, theoretically, toxoplasmosis could play a possible role in the development of T1D. However, the studies on this theory are still insufficient; therefore, this work was designed. Interestingly, in the case-control study, seropositivity of anti-Toxoplasma IgG was significantly higher among T1D (86.37%) in comparison with T2D (66.67%) and the control group (60%). Moreover, the odd ratio of chronic toxoplasmosis was 4.2 folds higher among T1D patients than among controls. The experimental study included acute and chronic Me49 T. gondii infected mice groups in addition to a control group. Pathological examination revealed the presence of T. gondii zoites adjacent to the islets of Langerhans and in pancreatic parenchyma of acutely infected mice. With chronic infection, there was a significant reduction of islets number and sizes in association with grade-1 insulitis. Additionally, the immunohistochemical study showed significant infiltration of the islets of chronically infected mice by CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD45<sup>+</sup> immune cells. In contrary to the control group, the islets of the chronic group showed significantly higher expression of the apoptotic marker caspase-3 and a significantly lower expression of the proliferation marker Ki69. Finally, a significant reduction of insulin expression in the islets of chronic infection group was detected in association with a significant increase in serum glucose concentrations; however, the establishment of diabetes did not occur throughout this work. Thus, this study presents an evidence for the probable role of chronic toxoplasmosis in the development of T1D which should be considered in further studies."

Supraventricular tachycardia, however, is an infrequent complication of diabetic ketoacidosis. We present the case of a child with a new-onset type 1 diabetes mellitus with supraventricular tachycardia as a complication of paediatric diabetic ketoacidosis. The patient received intravenous fluid resuscitation, insulin, and potassium supplementation and subsequently developed stable supraventricular tachycardia initially, confirmed on a 12-lead electrocardiogram despite a structurally normal heart and normal electrolytes. Vagal manoeuvers failed to achieve sinus rhythm. The patient went into respiratory distress and was intubated, for mechanical ventilation. She received one dose of adenosine with successful conversion to sinus rhythm and a heart rate decreased from 200 to 140 beats per minutes. We conclude that supraventricular tachycardia can occur as a complication of diabetic ketoacidosis, including in new-onset type 1 diabetes mellitus. Furthermore, a combination of acidosis, potassium derangement, falling magnesium, and phosphate levels may have precipitated the event.

We report a case of an acute IFRS caused by <i>Curvularia</i> in a patient with diabetes mellitus. An 18-year-old female presented to the emergency department with an acute onset of fever, headache, facial discomfort, and a blood glucose reading of 500 mg/dL. The patient was admitted for the management of hyperosmolar hyperglycemia. Her past medical history includes uncontrolled type 1 diabetes mellitus and a recent toothache. A computed tomography scan of the facial maxillary region revealed sinus disease with bony erosion. Empiric therapy with liposomal amphotericin B 400 mg i.v. every 24 hours, piperacillin/tazobactam 4.5 g i.v. every 6 hours and vancomycin 1 g i.v. every 12 hours was started. A functional endoscopic sinus surgery revealed invasive rhinosinusitis and cultures were positive for fungal elements. The patient was discharged on liposomal amphotericin B 400 mg i.v. daily and cefuroxime 500 mg orally twice daily. However, she was readmitted for the management of acute kidney injury and was discharged on itraconazole capsules 200 mg orally twice daily. Sinus cultures grew <i>Curvularia</i> and itraconazole was prescribed for 6 weeks, but the patient discontinued treatment after 3 weeks and had no signs or symptoms of rhinosinusitis when she was last seen in the clinic. The possibility of IFRS should be explored in patients with diabetes and signs and symptoms of rhinosinusitis."

To investigate whether these advances have been translated into continued improvement in glycemic control in Japanese children and adolescents, we analyzed the registration data of the two consecutive recent cohorts of Japanese childhood-onset T1DM patients. Methods The registration data including hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), hypoglycemia and insulin regimen were compared between the two cohorts (862 patients in the 2008 cohort and 1090 in the 2013 cohort). Results The proportion of subjects with multiple daily insulin injection therapy (MDI) and CSII significantly increased (p<0.0001) from 67.4% and 9.7% to 71.8% and 23.4%, respectively. In the 2013 cohort, almost all patients were treated with basal-bolus treatment using insulin analogs. The use of CSII increased in all age groups, especially in the age group 0-5 years. The rates of overall, moderate and severe hypoglycemia significantly declined from 10.24, 10.18 and 0.056 events/100 persons/period in the 2008 cohort to 0.66, 0.62 and 0.033 in the 2013 cohort (p<0.0001, <0.0001, 0.04), respectively. Contrarily, there were no significant changes in HbA1c values between the two cohorts. Conclusions The popularization of the basal-bolus treatment using insulin analogs hascontributed to a significant decrease in hypoglycemia. In contrast, the intensive insulin treatment may not be enough for the satisfactory improvement of glycemic control in Japanese children and adolescents with T1DM. Considerable points remain, such as diabetic education and support to motivate patients."

The precise molecular mechanisms of the etiology of T1DM are not completely understood. Oxidative stress and the antioxidant status of pancreatic <i>β</i>-cells play a vital role in the pathogenesis and progression of T1DM. The Keap1/Nrf2 signaling pathway plays a critical role in cellular resistance to oxidative stress. This study is aimed at investigating the role of the Keap1/Nrf2 signaling pathway in the progression of T1DM. An alloxan- (ALX-) stimulated T1DM animal model in wild-type (WT) and Nrf2 knockout (Nrf2<sup>-/-</sup>) C57BL/6J mice and a mouse pancreatic <i>β</i>-cell line (MIN6) were established. Compared with the tolerant (ALX exposure, nondiabetic) WT mice, the sensitive (ALX exposure, diabetic) WT mice exhibited higher blood glucose levels and lower plasma insulin levels. The Keap1/Nrf2 signaling pathway was significantly inhibited in the sensitive WT mice, which was reflected by overexpression of Keap1 and low expression of Nrf2, accompanied by a marked decrease in the expression of the antioxidative enzymes. Compared with WT mice, the Nrf2<sup>-/-</sup> mice had an increased incidence of T1DM and exhibited more severe pancreatic <i>β</i>-cell damage. The results of in vitro experiments showed that ALX significantly inhibited the viability and proliferation and promoted the apoptosis of MIN6 cells. ALX also markedly increased intracellular ROS production and caused DNA damage in MIN6 cells. In addition, the Keap1/Nrf2 signaling pathway was significantly inhibited in the damaged MIN6 cells. Moreover, Nrf2 silencing by transfection with Nrf2 siRNA markedly exacerbated ALX-induced MIN6 cell injury. Conclusively, this study demonstrates that inhibition of the Keap1/Nrf2 signaling pathway could significantly promote the incidence of T1DM. This study indicates that activation of Keap1/Nrf2 signaling in pancreatic <i>β</i>-cells may be a useful pharmacological strategy for the clinical prevention and treatment of T1DM."

Whether maternal infection during pregnancy is associated with T1DM in offspring is unknown. Therefore, we aimed to study the association using a systematic review and meta-analysis. Eighteen studies including 4304 cases and 25 846 participants were enrolled in this meta-analysis. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were synthesised using random-effects models. Subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of associations. Overall, the pooled analysis yielded a statistically significant association between maternal infection during pregnancy and childhood T1DM (OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.07-1.62). Furthermore, six studies that tested maternal enterovirus infection showed a pooled OR of 1.54 (95% CI 1.05-2.27). Heterogeneity from different studies was evident (I2 = 70.1%, P < 0.001) and was mainly attributable to the different study designs, ascertaining methods and sample size among different studies.

The patient had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at the age of 53 years and was treated using oral hypoglycemic agents. However, 2 years later, he was diagnosed with SPT1DM and autoimmune thyroiditis, based on the presence of anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies (GADA) and thyroid autoantibodies, which was accompanied by advanced renal cell carcinoma. At that time, his insulin secretory capacity was preserved (CPR 2.36 ng/mL), and good glycemic control was maintained using only medical nutrition therapy (HbA1c 6.3%). He subsequently developed destructive thyroiditis approximately 2 weeks after the first cycle of ICI treatment using nivolumab (a programmed cell death-1 inhibitor) and ipilimumab (a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 inhibitor) for advanced renal cell carcinoma. Three weeks later, his plasma glucose level markedly increased, and we detected absolute insulin deficiency and hypothyroidism. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) analysis revealed haplotypes indicating susceptibility to type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) or autoimmune thyroiditis (HLA genotype, DRB1-DQB1 *09:01-*03:03/*08:03-*06:01). He showed a good antitumor response and is currently receiving permanent insulin therapy and levothyroxine replacement with the ICI treatment. Based on this case and the available literature, patients with preexisting islet autoantibodies or SPT1DM/LADA, plus a genetic predisposition to T1DM, may have an extremely high risk of developing ICI-related T1DM for a brief period after starting ICI treatment."

However, we have not yet reported the detailed findings regarding the mechanical and density properties of the femoral neck. Therefore, we present a subanalysis of our previous study with the aim of further evaluating the middle third of the femoral neck via quadrant quantitative computed tomography in young and middle-aged patients with T1DM. Bone parameters in 4 anatomical quadrants (superoanterior [SA], inferoanterior [IA], inferoposterior [IP], and superoposterior [SP]) were cross-sectionally evaluated in 17 male T1DM patients and 18 sex-matched healthy controls aged between 18 and 49 yr using quadrant quantitative computed tomography analysis. Patients with T1DM had a thinner cortical thickness in the SP quadrant and a significantly lower cortical vBMD in the SA quadrant than the controls. The serum insulin-like growth factor-1 values in patients with T1DM were positively correlated with the average cortical thickness in the SA quadrant and the average trabecular vBMD in the SP quadrant of the femoral neck. The cortical thickness in controls was negatively correlated with age in the SP and IP quadrants. The cortical thickness in patients with T1DM showed no correlation with age in all quadrants. The fragility of the femoral neck was remarkable in the superior region of patients with T1DM. Insulin-like growth factor-1 may play an important role in superior cortical thinning and in lowering cortical vBMD. Furthermore, in young and middle-aged men with T1DM, the structure of the femoral neck exhibits similar changes as those observed with aging."

Emerging evidence suggests that dysbiosis in the gut microbiome plays a role in the pathogenesis of both diseases and may also be associated with the development of neuropathy. The primary goal in this cross-sectional pilot study was to identify whether there are distinct gut microbiota alterations in children with CD (<i>n</i> = 19), T1DM (<i>n</i> = 18) and both CD and T1DM (<i>n</i> = 9) compared to healthy controls (<i>n</i> = 12). Our second goal was to explore the relationship between neuropathy (corneal nerve fiber damage) and the gut microbiome composition. Microbiota composition was determined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Corneal confocal microscopy was used to determine nerve fiber damage. There was a significant difference in the overall microbial diversity between the four groups with healthy controls having a greater microbial diversity as compared to the patients. The abundance of pathogenic proteobacteria <i>Shigella</i> and <i>E. coli</i> were significantly higher in CD patients. Differential abundance analysis showed that several bacterial amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) distinguished CD from T1DM. The tissue transglutaminase antibody correlated significantly with a decrease in gut microbial diversity. Furthermore, the Bacteroidetes phylum, specifically the genus <i>Parabacteroides</i> was significantly correlated with corneal nerve fiber loss in the subjects with neuropathic damage belonging to the diseased groups. We conclude that disease-specific gut microbial features traceable down to the ASV level distinguish children with CD from T1DM and specific gut microbial signatures may be associated with small fiber neuropathy. Further research on the mechanisms linking altered microbial diversity with neuropathy are warranted."

Various autoimmune conditions have been reported with the use of these agents, including type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). This article reviews literature regarding the development of T1DM in patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors and identifies strategies for the appropriate identification, monitoring, and follow-up of these patients. Published cases of T1DM related to PD-1 inhibitor therapy were identified using PubMed. Eighty-three identified publications were reviewed, of which 37 publications involving 42 cases of anti-PD-1 therapy-induced T1DM were identified. The average age of patients at presentation was 62 years and 59.5% were male. The mean number of PD-1 inhibitor doses received was 5, with a mean time to presentation of 11 weeks.

The aim is to evaluate HRQoL estimated by young children with T1DM and by their mothers, potential discrepancies in the children-maternal estimates and the factors influencing these discrepancies. Thirty-five 4-to-6-year-old children (19 boys) with T1DM admitted to the Pediatric Endocrinology Department were approached with the self-report KINDL questionnaire for children aged 4-6 years (Kiddy-KINDL for children). Their mothers were approached with the parental version (Kiddy-KINDL for parents). Both versions enable measuring child HRQoL in physical, emotional wellbeing, self-esteem, family, friends, everyday functioning, and the disease dimensions, as well as KINDL total on a 0-100 scale. Statistically significant differences were found between children's and maternal estimates on the KINDL total and ""Disease"" scales, in that the maternal proxy-reports produced lower values. A statistically significant difference between self- and proxy-reports was found for the KINDL ""Emotional wellbeing"" scale values, and the maternal proxy-reports yielded higher estimates compared with children's self-reports. These associations remained significant after adjustment for major potential confounders. Maternal education, maternal marital status, insulin regimen, and achievement of glycemic control modified the effect of child-maternal discrepancies.Conclusion: Attempts should be made to improve parental understanding of child problems related to his/her disease with due account to individual family social and demographic characteristics. What is Known: • HRQoL in children with T1DM has been advocated as an important complementary outcome to clinical and laboratory markers. • Self-and parental proxy-reports on HRQoL may differ, but little is known on these discrepancies and on the factors influencing them in young children with T1DM. What is New: • Mothers tend to underestimate general and disease-related components of HRQoL but likely to overestimate psychological wellbeing of their ill young children with T1DM. • Maternal education, marital status, insulin regimen, and achievement of glycemic control modify estimations of HRQoL and child-maternal discrepancies."

The extracorporeal optical phase fluorimeter was miniaturised and is now comparable with commercial CGM systems regarding size, weight and wear comfort. Sensor chemistry was adapted to improve the adhesion of the sensor elements on the insulin infusion set. In-vitro tests showed a linear correlation of R<sup>2</sup>=0.998 between sensor values and reference glucose values in the range of 0-300mg/dl. Electrical and cytotoxicity tests showed no negative impact on human health. Two single-port devices were tested in each of 12 patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus in a clinical set-up for 12h. Without additional data processing, the overall median absolute relative difference (median ARD) was 22.5%. For some of the used devices the median ARD was even well below 10%. The present results show that individual glucose sensors performance of the single-port system is comparable with commercial CGM systems but further improvements are needed.

However, little is known about the molecular mechanism of the increased tissue uptake of trivalent inorganic arsenic in mice with T1DM. This study aimed to investigate the expression of the mammalian arsenic transporters aquaglyceroporins (AQPs) and glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) in T1DM mice and compare them with those in normal mice. Results showed that the levels of AQP9 and GLUT1 mRNA and protein were higher in T1DM mouse liver than in the normal one. The levels of AQP7 mRNA and protein were higher in T1DM mouse kidney. In the heart, we observed that the levels of AQP7 and GLUT1 mRNA and protein were higher in T1DM mice, but the levels of AQP9 mRNA and protein in the lung had no significant difference between both mice.

This study aims to develop and validate a prediction model and nomogram of CKD in T1DM patients using readily available routine checkup data for early CKD detection. This research utilized 1375 T1DM patients' sixteen years of longitudinal data from multi-center Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC) clinical trials conducted at 28 sites in the USA and Canada and considered 17 routinely available features. Three feature ranking algorithms, extreme gradient boosting (XGB), random forest (RF), and extremely randomized trees classifier (ERT), were applied to create three feature ranking lists, and logistic regression analyses were performed to develop CKD prediction models using these ranked feature lists to identify the best performing top-ranked features combination. Finally, the most significant features were selected to develop a multivariate logistic regression-based CKD prediction model for T1DM patients. This model was evaluated using sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, precision, and F1 score on train and test data. A nomogram of the final model was further generated for easy application in clinical practices. Hypertension, duration of diabetes, drinking habit, triglycerides, ACE inhibitors, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, age, and smoking habit were the top-8 features ranked by the XGB model and identified as the most important features for predicting CKD in T1DM patients. These eight features were selected to develop the final prediction model using multivariate logistic regression, which showed 90.04% and 88.59% accuracy in internal and test data validation. The proposed model showed excellent performance and can be used for CKD identification in T1DM patients during routine checkups."

The aim of this study was to analyze the change in the intermediate (CD14+CD16+) monocyte subset in children with recent-onset type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and its possible association with clinical parameters reflecting islet β-cell dysfunction. Compared with age- and sex-matched healthy controls, intermediate monocytes were expanded in children with T1DM, which was positively associated with hemoglobin A1C and negatively associated with serum insulin and C-peptide. Interestingly, the intermediate monocytes in T1DM patients expressed higher levels of human leukocyte antigen-DR and CD86, suggesting better antigen presentation capability. Further analysis revealed that the frequency of CD45RO+CD4+ memory T cells was increased in the T1DM patients, and the memory T cell content was well correlated with the increase in intermediate monocytes. These results suggest that expanded intermediate monocytes are a predictive factor for the poor residual islet β-cell function in children with recent-onset T1DM."

Multiple genetic and environmental factors found in variable combinations in individual patients are involved in the development of T1DM. Genetic risk is defined by the presence of particular allele combinations, which in the major susceptibility locus (the HLA region) affect T cell recognition and tolerance to foreign and autologous molecules. Multiple other loci also regulate and affect features of specific immune responses and modify the vulnerability of β-cells to inflammatory mediators. Compared with the genetic factors, environmental factors that affect the development of T1DM are less well characterized but contact with particular microorganisms is emerging as an important factor. Certain infections might affect immune regulation, and the role of commensal microorganisms, such as the gut microbiota, are important in the education of the developing immune system. Some evidence also suggests that nutritional factors are important. Multiple islet-specific autoantibodies are found in the circulation from a few weeks to up to 20 years before the onset of clinical disease and this prediabetic phase provides a potential opportunity to manipulate the islet-specific immune response to prevent or postpone β-cell loss. The latest developments in understanding the heterogeneity of T1DM and characterization of major disease subtypes might help in the development of preventive treatments."

Blood and urine samples were collected and body mass index (BMI) was calculated. Each participant was provided with the intermittently scanned glucose monitoring system (isCGM) Freestyle Libre. During the second visit (3 months from the start of the trial), glycemic parameters were collected from the reports generated from the Freestyle Libre system. Estimated glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) values were significantly lower after three months compared to baseline HbA1c (Wilcoxon test, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). An inverse correlation between the number of daily scans and degree of extraversion among subjects was observed, e.g., higher degrees of extraversion resulted in lower numbers of daily scans, while lower degrees of extraversion, i.e., introvertedness, resulted in higher numbers of daily scans (<i>Rho</i> = -0.238 <i>p</i> = 0.009). There was a positive correlation between emotional stability and time spent in hypoglycemia (<i>Rho</i> = 0.214; <i>p</i> = 0.02). In addition, a shorter duration of diabetes was associated with higher percentages of TIR and vice versa (<i>p</i> = 0.02).

ANIMALS 30 client-owned dogs, of which 10 had normotensive type 1 diabetes mellitus and 20 were healthy. PROCEDURES All dogs underwent physical examination, laboratory analyses, standard echocardiography, and TDI. RESULTS On TDI and strain imaging, transmitral peak early diastolic velocity (E)-to-tissue Doppler-derived peak early diastolic velocity at basal segment (E') of septum ratio, E:lateral E' ratio, and septal tissue Doppler-derived peak late diastolic velocity at basal segment (A') were significantly higher and the septal E':A' ratio and lateral longitudinal strain were significantly lower for diabetic dogs than for control dogs. Furthermore, in diabetic dogs, serum glucose and fructosamine concentrations after a 12-hour period of food withholding were positively correlated with regional systolic functional variables (septal and lateral longitudinal strain) and left ventricular filling pressure indices (E:septal E' and E:lateral E' ratios) but were negatively correlated with diastolic functional variables (E:transmitral peak late diastolic velocity and septal and lateral E':A' ratios). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Results indicated that myocardial function in diabetic dogs may be altered before the development of clinical heart-associated signs and that the change may be more readily detected by TDI and strain imaging than by conventional echocardiography. In addition, findings indicated that hyperglycemia could have detrimental effects on myocardial function, independent of hypertension, other cardiac diseases, and left ventricular hypertrophy, in dogs with type 1 diabetes."

An association was found between noticing a lot of stress in the home environment and stopping physical activity; lower levels of tolerance to social distancing were associated with less physical activity, and maintaining the habit of practicing physical activity was associated with decreasing the intensity of the practice. Hence, social distancing harmed the practice of physical activity as part of the treatment of individuals with T1DM, both in the habit of practicing and in the characteristics of these practices of physical activity, such as frequency, duration, and intensity."

These patients are at increased risk of developing secondary infections due to a combination of virus- and drug-induced immunosuppression. Recently, several countries have reported an emergence of COVID-19 associated mucormycosis (CAM), particularly among patients with uncontrolled diabetes, with India reporting an alarming increase in rhino-orbito-cerebral mucormycosis (ROCM) in post-COVID cases. Hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) are the major underlying risk factors. So far, case reports and review articles have reported CAM only in adult patients. Here, we describe the first cases of COVID-19-associated ROCM in two pediatric patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM). Both the cases had asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2 and developed ROCM during the course of treatment of DKA. None of them had exposure to systemic steroids. Imaging findings in both cases revealed involvement of orbit, paranasal sinuses, and brain with cavernous sinus thrombosis. The patients underwent craniotomy with evacuation of abscess. Microbiological and histopathological findings were consistent with the diagnosis of mycormycosis, with fungal culture growing Rhizopus arrhizus. Post-operatively, the patients received liposomal amphotericin B (LAMB) and systemic antibiotics. Retrobulbar injection of LAMB was given in an attempt to halt orbital disease progression. However, it wasn't successful and both of them had to undergo orbital exenteration eventually. ROCM is a rapidly progressive disease and prompt diagnosis with aggressive surgery and timely initiation of antifungal therapy can be life-saving. Physicians should have a high index of suspicion, so as to avoid a delayed diagnosis, particularly in post-COVID patients with uncontrolled diabetes."

This is of importance, since skeletal muscle is the largest of the insulin-sensitive tissues and thus plays a significant role in glucose homeostasis. A prime regulator of skeletal muscle mass is myostatin, a protein which has a negative role in skeletal muscle development but also in glucose homeostasis, causing insulin resistance. Since myopathy is a complication of T1DM and myostatin is a fundamental regulator of skeletal muscle and is also involved in glucose homeostasis, we investigated the serum levels of myostatin in children with T1DM."

Adolescents with T1DM also develop early changes in blood pressure, cardiovascular structure, and function. Our aims were to define the relationships between hyperfiltration, ACR, and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure over time in adolescents with T1DM. Normotensive, normoalbuminuric adolescents ( n = 98) with T1DM underwent baseline and 2-yr 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) estimated by cystatin C (Larsson equation)<sub>,</sub> and ACR measurements. Linear regression models adjusted for diabetes duration, sex, and HbA1c were used to determine associations. Hyperfiltration (eGFR ≥ 133 ml/min) was present in 31% at baseline and 21% at 2-yr follow-up.

Not only genetics, but the intestinal environment affected by gut microbiota is also the key to pathogenesis. Besides the occurrence of diabetes, gut microbiota dysbiosis may also contribute to the development of diabetes-related complications. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is an emerging technique that had shown its potential as a treatment for metabolic disease. Here, we report the first case of T1DM with malnutrition and gastrointestinal symptoms treated with FMT. A 24-year-old T1DM patient suffered from poor blood glucose control, recurrent nausea and vomiting, severe malnutrition, and intractable constipation after insulin treatment. The clinical response of the patients after FMT was well, especially nausea and vomiting were significantly relieved. In addition, constipation, nutritional status, and blood glucose control (fasting blood glucose, HbA1c) gradually improved. A degree of similarity was found in gut microbiota composition between the patient and healthy donor after FMT while it was totally different before the treatment. Furthermore, pathway function analysis of MetaCYC database implies that the potential mechanism of the response of FMT may be driven by specific bacteria involved in several metabolic pathways that need further exploration. To sum up, we believe that the reconstruction of intestinal flora by FMT may be a new choice for the treatment of T1DM patients with malnutrition."

T1DM usually starts in adolescence or develops directly as a severe disease state of ketoacidosis. T1DM and its complications make many people suffer and have psychological problems, which make us have to pay more attention to the prevention and early control of T1DM. Cognitive impairment (CI) is one of the major complications of T1DM. It can further develop into Alzheimer's disease, which can seriously affect the quality of life of the elderly. Furthermore, the relationship between T1DM and CI is unclear. Hence, we conducted a narrative review of the existing literature through a PubMed search. We summarized some risk factors that may be associated with the cognitive changes in T1DM patients, including onset age and duration, education and gender, glycemic states, microvascular complications, glycemic control, neuropsychology and emotion, intestinal flora, dyslipidemia, sleep quality.

Analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in exhaled breath is non-invasive and appears as a promising tool. However, data on breath VOC profiles in pediatric patients are limited. We conducted a cross-sectional study and applied quantitative analysis of exhaled VOCs in children suffering from type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) (n = 53) and healthy controls (n = 60). Both groups were matched for sex and age. For breath gas analysis, a very sensitive direct mass spectrometric technique (PTR-TOF) was applied. The duration of disease, the mode of insulin application (continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion vs. multiple daily insulin injection) and long-term metabolic control were considered as classifiers in patients. The concentration of exhaled VOCs differed between T1DM patients and healthy children. In particular, T1DM patients exhaled significantly higher amounts of ethanol, isopropanol, dimethylsulfid, isoprene and pentanal compared to healthy controls (171, 1223, 19.6, 112 and 13.5 ppbV vs. 82.4, 784, 11.3, 49.6, and 5.30 ppbV). The most remarkable differences in concentrations were found in patients with poor metabolic control, i.e. those with a mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> above 8%. In conclusion, non-invasive breath testing may support the discovery of basic metabolic mechanisms and adaptation early in the progress of T1DM."

Regular exercise is strongly recommended to these patients due to its cardiovascular and metabolic benefits. However, a large percentage of patients with T1DM people present a sedentary behavior because of the fear of a post-exercise hypoglycemia event, lack of time, lack of motivation and the complicated management of exercise, glycemic and insulin dose interaction. High-intensity interval training (HIIT) is an efficient and safe methodology since it prevents hypoglycemia and does not require much time, which are the main barriers for this population to doing exercise and increasing physical conditioning. (2) Methods: Nineteen sedentary adults (37 ± 6.5 years) with T1DM, were randomly assigned to 6 weeks of either HIIT (12-16-20 × 30-s intervals interspersed with 1-min rest periods) performed thrice weekly, or to the control group, which did not train. HRQoL, sleep quality, exercise motivation and enjoyment were measured as psychological variables. (4) Results: HRQoL improved in physical and social domains, PF (1.9%); PR (80.3%); GH (16.6); SF (34.1%). Sleep quality improved in the HIIT group by 21.4%. Enjoyment improved by 7% and intrinsic motivation was increased by 13%. (5) Conclusions: We suggest that the 6-week HIIT program used in the present study is safe, since no severe hypoglycemia were reported, and an effective strategy in improving HRQoL, sleep quality, exercise motivation and enjoyment which are important psychological well-being factors in T1DM people."

Here, we investigated the impact of damaging exercise (eccentric quadriceps contractions) in 18 physically active young adults with and without T1D. Pre- and postexercise (48 h and 96 h), the participants provided blood samples, vastus lateralis biopsies, and performed maximal voluntary quadriceps contractions (MVCs). Skeletal muscle sarcolemmal integrity, extracellular matrix (ECM) content, and satellite cell (SC) content/proliferation were assessed by immunofluorescence. Transmission electron microscopy was used to quantify ultrastructural damage. MVC was comparable between T1D and controls before exercise. Postexercise, MVC was decreased in both groups, but subjects with T1D exhibited moderately lower strength recovery at both 48 h and 96 h. Serum creatine kinase, an indicator of muscle damage, was moderately higher in participants with T1D at rest and exhibited a small elevation 96 h postexercise. Participants with T1D showed lower SC content at all timepoints and demonstrated a moderate delay in SC proliferation after exercise. A greater number of myofibers exhibited sarcolemmal damage (disrupted dystrophin) and increased ECM (laminin) content in participants with T1D despite no differences between groups in ultrastructural damage as assessed by electron microscopy. Finally, transcriptomic analyses revealed dysregulated gene networks involving RNA translation and mitochondrial respiration, providing potential explanations for previous observations of mitochondrial dysfunction in similar cohorts with T1D. Our findings indicate that skeletal muscle in young adults with moderately controlled T1D is altered after damaging exercise, suggesting that longer recovery times following intense exercise may be necessary."

Different factors, including genetics and viruses may contribute to T1D, but the causes of T1D are not fully known, and there is currently no cure. The advent of high-throughput technologies has revolutionized the field of medicine and biology, and analysis of multi-source data along with clinical information has brought a better understanding of the mechanisms behind disease pathogenesis. The aim of this work was the development of a data repository linking clinical information and interactome studies in T1D. To address this goal, we analyzed the electronic health records and online databases of genes, proteins, miRNAs, and pathways to have a global view of T1D. There were common comorbid diseases such as anemia, hypertension, vitreous diseases, renal diseases, and atherosclerosis in the phenotypic disease networks. In the protein-protein interaction network, CASP3 and TNF were date-hub proteins involved in several pathways. Moreover, CTNNB1, IGF1R, and STAT3 were hub proteins, whereas miR-155-5p, miR-34a-5p, miR-23-3p, and miR-20a-5p were hub miRNAs in the gene-miRNA interaction network. Multiple levels of information including genetic, protein, miRNA and clinical data resulted in multiple results, which suggests the complementarity of multiple sources.

Detailed metabolic analyses revealed 12%-61% and up to 20% lower whole-body (skeletal muscle) and hepatic insulin sensitivity in type 1 diabetes, depending on the population studied. Type 1 diabetes patients feature impaired muscle adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis and enhanced oxidative stress, predominantly relating to hyperglycemia. They may also exhibit abnormal fasting and postprandial glycogen metabolism in liver, while the role of hepatic energy metabolism for insulin resistance remains uncertain. Recent rodent studies point to tissue-specific differences in the mechanisms underlying insulin resistance. In non-obese diabetic mice, increased lipid availability contributes to muscle insulin resistance via diacylglycerol/protein kinase C isoforms. Furthermore, humans with type 1 diabetes respond to lifestyle modifications or metformin by 20%-60% increased whole-body insulin sensitivity, likely through improvement in both glycemic control and oxidative phosphorylation. Intensive insulin treatment and islet transplantation also increase but fail to completely restore whole-body and hepatic insulin sensitivity. In conclusion, insulin resistance is a feature of type 1 diabetes, but more controlled trials are needed to address its contribution to disease progression, which might help to optimize treatment and reduce comorbidities."

Periodontitis microbiota might affect the immune homeostasis of diabetes, but the molecular mechanism of their interactions is still not clear. The aims of this study were to clarify the possible immune regulatory effects of periodontitis microbiota on diabetes and the correlation between immunomodulation and ectopic colonization. A model of germ-free mice with streptozotocin-induced type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D), which was orally inoculated with mixed saliva samples for 2 weeks, was used in this study. Those mice were randomly divided into two groups, namely, SP (where the T1D mice were orally inoculated with mixed saliva samples from periodontitis patients) and SH (where the T1D mice were orally inoculated with mixed saliva samples from healthy subjects). Ectopic colonization of saliva microbiota was assessed using culture-dependent method and Sanger sequencing, and the composition of gut microbiota was analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Changes in 15 types of immune cells and six cytokines either from the small intestine or spleen were detected by multicolor flow cytometry. The correlation between gut microbiota and immune cells was evaluated by redundancy analysis. Although periodontitis microbiota minorly colonized the lungs, spleens, and blood system, they predominantly colonized the gut, which was mainly invaded by <i>Klebsiella</i>. SH and SP differed in beta diversity of the gut bacterial community. Compared to SH, microbial alteration in small intestine occurred with an increase of <i>Lacticaseibacillus</i>, <i>Bacillus</i>, <i>Agathobacter</i>, <i>Bacteroides</i>, and a decrease of <i>Raoultella</i> in SP. More types of immune cells were disordered in the spleen than in the small intestine by periodontitis microbiota, mainly with a dramatical increase in the proportion of macrophages, plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), monocytes, group 3 innate lymphoid cells, CD4-CD8- T cells and Th17 cells, as well as a decline of αβT cells in SP. Cytokines of IFNγ, IL17, and IL22 produced by CD4 + T cells as well as IL22 produced by ILCs of small intestine rose in numbers, and the intestinal and splenic pDCs were positively regulated by gut bacterial community in SP. In conclusion, periodontitis microbiota invasion leads to ectopic colonization of the extra-oral sites and immune cells infiltration, which might cause local or systemic inflammation. Those cells are considered to act as a ""bridge"" between T1D and periodontitis."

A supervised exercise intervention with baseline to follow-up comparison between overweight (BMI = 28.6 ± 2.1 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and normal weight (BMI = 23.2 ± 1.40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) T1DM patients was performed. Eleven overweight (age = 40.7 ± 14.3 years) and 11 normal weight (age = 42.2 ± 15.5 years) T1DM patients performed a four-week, low-volume, all-out cycling HIIT (4-6 bouts, work/relief ratio 1:1) twice weekly. HIIT lowered low-density lipoprotein and uric acid levels in overweight patients by up to 10.5% (vs. normal weight, <i>p</i>≤0.0312). HbA1c, high-density lipoprotein, and triglyceride levels did not change in any of the groups. Participants' maximal exercise capacity and power output at individual anaerobic lactate threshold increased to an equal extend of up to 10% (<i>p</i>≤0.0002) in both groups. During the intervention, participants used fewer daily bolus insulin (-5.22 ± 12.80%) and less total units of insulin (-4.42 ± 10.20%, <i>p</i>≤0.023) compared to the pre-intervention period with no between-group difference. Overall, the average daily number of hypoglycaemias increased from 0.90 ± 0.56-1.08 ± 0.63 during the intervention (<i>p</i> = 0.033). SF-36 subscales showed higher scores after the intervention, with a significant improvement of ""role limitations due to physical problems"" (<i>p</i><0.05) for both groups.

A 27-year-old woman with insulin-requiring GDM presented with rapidly deteriorating glycaemic control in her third trimester of pregnancy despite good concordance to treatment. The investigation identified the hallmarks of FT1DM: hyperglycaemia with acute metabolic decompensation and non-immune-mediated beta-cell failure. She received prompt treatment with intravenous insulin therapy and was transitioned to subcutaneous insulin once biochemical improvement had been achieved, albeit with higher insulin requirements than before. She had a good pregnancy outcome and delivered a healthy male infant 5 weeks later through induction of labour. Due to persistent beta-cell dysfunction, she remained on basal-bolus insulin postpartum. This case highlights the importance of early recognition and treatment of FT1DM in pregnancy to prevent adverse maternal and fetal prognoses."

To diagnose AKI, the availability of a baseline serum creatinine (bSCr) is pivotal. However, in most hospitalized children the bSCr is unknown. We aimed to test whether the bSCr estimated on the basis of height (ebSCr) could be a reliable surrogate for AKI diagnosis compared with the measured bSCr (mbSCr). As the mbSCr, we considered the creatinine measured 14 days after T1DM onset while ebSCr (mg/dL) = (k × height [cm])/120 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, where k = 0.55 for children and adolescent girls and k = 0.7 for adolescent boys. AKI was defined as serum creatinine values &gt;1.5 times the baseline creatinine. Kappa statistics and the percentage of agreement in AKI classification by ebSCr-AKI versus mbSCr-AKI definition methods were calculated. Bland-Altman plots were used to show the agreement between the creatinine ratio (highest/baseline creatinine; HC/BC) calculated with mbSCr and ebSCr. The number of 163 patients with T1DM onset were included. On the basis of mbSCr, 66/163 (40.5%) presented AKI while, on the basis of ebSCr, 50/163 (30.7%) accomplished AKI definition. ebSCr showed good correlation with mbSCr using both the Spearman test (rho = 0.67; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and regression analysis (r = 0.68; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Moreover, at the Bland-Altman plots, the bias of the highest/baseline creatinine ratio calculated on the basis of the mbSCr compared to ebSCr was minimal (bias = -0.08 mg/dL; 95% limits of agreement = -0.23/0.39). AKI determined using ebSCr showed 90% agreement with AKI determined using mbSCr (kappa = 0.66; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Finally, we compared the area under a receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of HC/BC ratio calculated on the basis of ebSCr with AUROC of the gold standard HC/BC ratio calculated on the basis of mbSCr. As expected, the gold standard had an AUROC = 1.00 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) between 0.98 and 1.00, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001. The HC/BC ratio calculated on the basis of ebSCr also had significant AUROC (AUROC = 0.94; 95% CI: 0.90-0.97; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). The comparison of the two ROC curves showed a <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001.

Specifically, we examined the role of peak estrogen (E2) concentrations during proestrus on BG response to prolonged repetitive aerobic exercise. To do so, nineteen Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to four exercised groups: control female (CXF; n = 5), control male (CXM; n = 5), diabetic female (DXF, n = 5) and diabetic male (DXM, n = 4). Diabetes was induced in DX groups via subcutaneous multiple injections of low dose streptozotocin (20mg/day for 7 days). After four days of exercise, muscle and liver glycogen content, liver gluconeogenic enzyme content, muscle Beta oxidation activity and BG responses to exercise were compared. The final bout of exercise took place during proestrus when E2 concentrations were at their highest in the female rats. During days 1-3 DXM had significantly lower BG concentrations during exercise than DXF. While both T1DM and non-T1DM females demonstrated higher hepatic G6Pase expression and muscle beta oxidation activity levels on day 4 exercise, no differences in BG response between the male and female T1DM rats were evident. Further, no differences in liver and muscle glycogen content following day 4 of exercise were seen between the sexes. These results would suggest that heightened E2 levels during proestrus may not be an important factor governing glucose counter regulatory response to exercise in female T1DM rats.

We used FreeStyle Libre for a patient with type 1 diabetes mellitus during the perioperative period of cardiac surgery except during and just after surgery. We adjusted the insulin amount according to the glucose level of the device before surgery and prevented prolonged hypoglycemia. After surgery, we could also adjust the blood sugar levels using the device until discharge. All data were within zones A and B of the Clarke error grid analysis when referred to as arterial blood sugar levels in the intensive care unit. In the general ward after surgery, 95% of the data referred to as venous blood sugar levels were within zones A and B. FreeStyle Libre was useful for adjusting the amount of insulin for a patient with type 1 diabetes mellitus during the perioperative period of cardiac surgery in the ward and also might be useful for decreasing the frequency of arterial blood collection in the intensive care unit."
29944065,Fatigue Among Adults With Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus and Implications for Self-Management: An Integrative Review.,[],"['Stephanie Griggs', 'Nancy S Morris']","Purpose The aim of this review was to integrate empirical and theoretical literature on fatigue among adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). A methodological review using an integrative approach was used. Databases MEDLINE via Pubmed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Science Direct were searched for peer-reviewed articles published in English from 2007-2017, using the following search terms and Boolean operators: ""Type 1 Diabetes"" and ""Fatigue."" Of 199 articles initially retrieved, 14 were chosen for inclusion. These articles included 13 quantitative (7 cross-sectional, 2 cohort, 2 secondary data analyses, 2 experimental) and 1 qualitative phenomenology. Fatigue was identified as one of the most troublesome symptoms reported in persons with T1DM. Four main themes emerged: fatigue in T1DM is multidimensional and related to psychological, physiological, situational, and sociodemographic factors. Conclusions Fatigue is considered a classic symptom of hyperglycemia; however, there were minimal data to support the theory that fatigue is related to hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia. Studies on fatigue among persons with T1DM are limited to small samples and cross-sectional designs with few randomized controlled trials addressing fatigue and diabetes-related symptoms. Evidence is conflicting regarding the onset of fatigue among persons with T1DM and the relationship between fatigue and diabetes duration. The prevalence of fatigue is likely influenced by disease physiology, psychological stress, and lifestyle factors, but more research is needed to confirm these relationships as causal inference is unclear."

This study was conducted to assess the cardiovascular risk by comparing arterial stiffness in type 1 diabetes with that of controls. Thirty-one type 1 diabetes patients and 31 age- and gender-matched controls were included. The brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (ba-PWV) was measured using Periscope, a noninvasive device. The ba-PWV was found to be significantly elevated among the patients with diabetes (1177.09 ± 180.1 cm/s) when compared with the controls (1057.99 ± 95.8 cm/s) (P = .003). The ba-PWV showed positive correlation with age (r = .43, P = .014), heart rate (r = .49, P = .005), blood pressure (r = .65, P < .001), and LDL (r = .46, P = .008) among patients with diabetes. Linear regression analysis revealed that diabetes, age, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and BMI were independently associated with ba-PWV (R (2) = .589). On subdividing the diabetes cohort into quintiles for LDL and SBP, a substantial increase in ba-PWV was seen at LDL > 102 mg/dl (1187.8 cm/s to 1364.9 cm/s, P = .09) and SBP > 130 mmHg (1176.1 cm/s to 1369.4 cm/s, P = .03). Arterial stiffness as assessed by ba-PWV is significantly increased among patients with type 1 diabetes compared to healthy controls, independent of traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Early screening for arterial stiffness using a cheap and effective method among patients with SBP > 130 mmHg and LDL > 102 mg/dl may help identify those with heightened cardiovascular risk. "

Consequent hyperglycemia is requiring lifelong insulin replacement therapy. T1DM is caused by the interaction of multiple environmental and genetic factors. The integrations of environments and genes occur via epigenetic regulations of the genome, which allow adaptation of organism to changing life conditions by alternation of gene expression. T1DM has increased several-fold over the past half century. Such a short time indicates involvement of environment factors and excludes genetic changes. This review summarizes the most current knowledge of epigenetic changes in that process leading to autoimmune diabetes mellitus."

Risk stratification strategies, such as biomarkers measured in the first trimester of pregnancy, could help identify high-risk women. The literature on T1DM-specific pre-eclampsia biomarkers is expanding. We aimed to provide a narrative review of recently published evidence to identify the most promising biomarker candidates that could be targeted for clinical implementation in existing PE models. <b>Methods:</b> A search using MeSH terms was carried out of Medline, EMBASE, Maternity and Infant Care, Web of Science, and Scopus for relevant papers published since 2015 inclusive and in English. The time limit was applied from the publication of the preceding systematic review in this field. Included studies had pre-eclampsia as a primary outcome, measured one or more serum, plasma or urine biomarkers at any time during pregnancy, and had a distinct group of women with T1DM who developed pre-eclampsia. Studies with pre-eclampsia as a composite outcome were not considered. No restrictions on study types were applied. A narrative synthesis approach was adopted for analysis. <b>Results:</b> A total of 510 records were screened yielding 18 eligible studies relating to 32 different biomarkers. Higher first-trimester levels of HbA1c and urinary albumin were associated with an increased risk of pre-eclampsia development in women with T1DM. Urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and adipokines were novel biomarkers showing moderate predictive ability before 15 gestational weeks. Two T1DM-specific pre-eclampsia prediction models were proposed, measuring adipokines or urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin together with easily attainable maternal clinical characteristics. Contradicting previous literature, pre-eclampsia risk in women with T1DM was correlated with vitamin D levels and atherogenic lipid profile in the context of haptoglobin phenotype 2-2. Pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A and soluble endoglin did not predict pre-eclampsia in women with T1DM, and soluble Fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 only predicted pre-eclampsia from the third trimester. <b>Conclusion:</b> Maternally derived biomarkers reflecting glycemic control, insulin resistance and renal dysfunction performed better as PE predictors among women with T1DM than those derived from the placenta. These biomarkers could be trialed in current PE prediction algorithms to tailor them for women with T1DM."

Areas covered: In this review, the authors summarize results from studies on the sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor dapagliflozin in T1DM. Expert opinion: In T1DM, dapagliflozin is associated with significant antihyperglycemic and metabolic properties, which are achieved with reduction or stabilization of insulin dose and with a very low trend for hypoglycemia.

Nevertheless, a critical role has recently been assigned to intestinal microorganisms in T1DM disease pathogenesis. In particular, a decrease in intestinal microbial diversity, increase in intestinal permeability, and the translocation of intestinal bacteria to the pancreas have been reported in patients and animal models with T1DM. Moreover, intestinal microbial metabolites differ between healthy individuals and patients with T1DM. Specifically, short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production, which contributes to intestinal barrier integrity and immune response regulation, is significantly reduced in patients with T1DM. Considering this correlation between intestinal microorganisms and T1DM, many studies have investigated the potential of intestinal microbiota in preventive and therapeutic strategies for T1DM."

Both hypertension and T1DM are well-known risk factors for cardiovascular disease and kidney failure. The human microbiome has been linked to both diabetes and hypertension, but the relationship between the gut microbiome and BP in children with T1DM is not well-understood. In this cross-sectional study, we examined the relationship between resting office BP and gut microbiota composition, diversity, and richness in children with T1DM and healthy controls. We recruited 29 pediatric subjects and divided them into three groups: healthy controls (HC, n = 5), T1DM with normal BP (T1DM-Normo, n = 17), and T1DM with elevated BP (T1DM-HBP, n = 7). We measured the BP, dietary and clinical parameters for each subject. We collected fecal samples to perform the 16s rDNA sequencing and to measure the short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) level. The microbiome downstream analysis included the relative abundance of microbiota, alpha and beta diversity, microbial markers using Linear Discriminant effect size analysis (LEfSe), potential gut microbial metabolic pathways using Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt) and metabolic pathways validation using Statistical Inference of Associations between Microbial Communities And host phenotype (SIAMCAT) machine learning toolbox. Our study results showed that T1DM-HBP group had distinct gut microbial composition (at multiple taxonomic levels) and reduced diversity (richness and abundance) compared with T1DM-Normo and HC groups. Children with T1DM-HBP showed a significant reduction of Bifidobacterium levels (especially B. adolescentis, B. bifidum, and B. longum) compared to the T1DM-Normo group. We also observed unique gut-microbial metabolic pathways, such as elevated lipopolysaccharide synthesis and glutathione metabolism in children with T1DM-HBP compared to T1DM-Normo children. We can conclude that the reduction in the abundance of genus Bifidobacterium could play a significant role in elevating the BP in pediatric T1DM subjects. More studies are needed to corroborate our findings and further explore the potential contributing mechanisms we describe."

This study was conducted to describe the pattern of lower limb nerve involvement in children with type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) based on the parameters of nerve conduction study (NCS). This cross-sectional study recruited 50 children with type 1 DM having mean disease duration of 4.92 ± 3.84 years who attended the referred clinic in Sudan Childhood Diabetes Center. Their mean age was 15.00 ± 2.19 years, 42% were males, and 58% were females. Twenty six matched healthy control subjects were involved; their mean age was 13.88 ± 2.46 years, 38.46% were males, and 61.54% were females. Bilateral NCS of the sensory and motor lower limb nerves was performed using Medelec Synergy machine. Interpretation of the patients' results was based on our own control reference values. Data was analysed using IBM SPSS statistics. Out of the 50 diabetic patients, 44 (88%) had electrophysiological evidence of peripheral neuropathy (abnormalities in at least two of the electrophysiological parameters). The majority (68.2%) had motor involvement and 31.8% had sensorimotor, while none of them (0%) had pure sensory involvement. Regarding abnormal NCS parameters (conduction velocity vs. amplitude of the compound action potential), conduction slowing feature predominated in 61.4% and only few (6.8%) showed amplitude reduction, while 31.8% showed mixed features. The most frequently affected nerve was the common peroneal, followed by posterior tibial, and the least was the sural nerve. The most sensitive parameter was the common peroneal conduction velocity. Motor precedes sensory nerve involvement. The most frequent neurophysiological abnormality was the conduction slowing, and the common peroneal was the most vulnerable nerve. These findings signify generation of a protocol for early screening of neuropathy in children with type 1 diabetes."

New insulin analogues and novel technologies allowing more tailored insulin administration have improved the quality of life of people with T1DM, but issues like hypoglycemia, weight gain and variability in glucose profiles remain problematic. Areas covered: In this review, the clinical efficacy, safety and tolerability of dapagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 inhibitor, in type 1 diabetes (T1DM) is described based on a review of phase 2 and 3 studies to date. Expert opinion: Dapagliflozin has shown promising results as an adjunct therapy in T1DM, resulting in better glucose control, weight loss and lower blood pressure. No increase in hypoglycemia risk, in particular severe hypoglycemia, was observed, but, in comparison with reports in Type 2 diabetes (T2DM), genital infections were more prevalent. Dapagliflozin use was accompanied with decreases in insulin doses, but, to date, only a low risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) was reported. However, caution is needed when interpreting this data, arising from well controlled clinical trials, with intensive education programs around ketone measurements and DKA prevention. Further studies will need to establish how high the DKA risk is and how to mitigate this in a real-world setting."

PD-1 receptors are also interspersed in endocrine organs and pembrolizumab use has long been associated with hypophysitis and thyroiditis. Since the introduction of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), several cases of fulminant type 1 diabetes mellitus (FT1DM) have been reported. However, it is unclear if FT1DM and ICI-induced diabetes are the same pathology. We review the existing literature of ICI-induced diabetes to investigate its nature and to what extent it represents type 1A diabetes and/or FT1DM (type 1B diabetes) using an example case. Our review showed that ICI-induced diabetes may be a different entity to FT1DM. Furthermore, there is limited evidence for the management of ICI-induced T1DM.

Recently, it was shown that patients with both T1D and AD have a higher risk of premature death compared to patients with T1D alone, the most common causes of death being due to diabetic complications and cardiovascular disease. These patients receiving replacement therapies with both insulin and glucocorticoids face an increased risk of hypo- and hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis and have a higher risk of adrenal crisis than patients with AD alone. Treatment challenges include the opposing effects of insulin and glucocorticoids on glucose homeostasis and the need to balance and synchronize these two treatments. The rarity of this disease combination may explain the paucity of data on outcome and specific treatment strategies in this patient group. Based on this review, we suggest management strategies for their insulin and glucocorticoid replacement therapies and indicate future areas of research."

Methods and Results We examined cardiovascular risk factors ( CVRF s) and arterial parameters in 1809 youth with T1DM. Demographics, anthropometrics, blood pressure, and laboratory data were collected at T1DM onset and 5 years later. Pulse wave velocity and augmentation index were collected with tonometry. ANOVA or chi-square tests were used to test for differences in measures of arterial parameters by CVRF . Area under the curve of CVRF s was entered in general linear models to explore determinants of accelerate vascular aging. Participants at the time of arterial measurement were 17.6±4.5 years old, 50% female, 76% non-Hispanic white, and duration of T1DM was 7.8±1.9 years. Glycemic control was poor (glycated hemoglobin, 9.1±1.8%). All arterial parameters were higher in participants with glycated hemoglobin ≥9% and pulse wave velocity was higher with lower insulin sensitivity or longer duration of diabetes mellitus. Differences in arterial parameters were found by sex, age, and presence of obesity, hypertension, or dyslipidemia. In multivariable models, higher glycated hemoglobin, lower insulin sensitivity, body mass index, blood pressure, and lipid areas under the curve were associated with accelerated vascular aging. Conclusions In young people with T1DM, persistent poor glycemic control and higher levels of traditional CVRF s are independently associated with arterial aging. Improving glycemic control and interventions to lower CVRF s may prevent future cardiovascular events in young individuals with T1DM."

One-hundred-thirty-one type 1 diabetes and 111 control organ donor pancreata from persons 12-89 years of age (mean 29.8 ± 15.5 years) within the Network for Pancreatic Organ donors with Diabetes (nPOD) were examined for insulin positivity, insulitis, amyloid staining, acute and chronic pancreatitis, and chronic exocrine changes (acinar atrophy, fibrosis, fatty infiltration, or periductal fibrosis); findings were compared by history of substance use. A secondary analysis compared exocrine pancreatic histopathologic findings in type 1 diabetes versus control organ donors regardless of substance use history. We observed a high but congruent rate of substance use in type 1 diabetes and control organ donors (66.4% and 64% respectively). Among donors with type 1 diabetes (but not controls), islet amyloid (OR 9.96 [1.22, 81.29]) and acute pancreatitis (OR 3.2 [1.06, 9.63]) were more common in alcohol users while chronic exocrine changes (OR 8.86 [1.13, 69.31]) were more common in cocaine users. Substance use impacted the pancreata of donors with type 1 diabetes more than controls. Overall, despite similar rates of substance use, acute pancreatitis (15.3% versus 4.5%, p=0.0061), chronic pancreatitis (29.8% versus 9.9%, p=0.0001), and chronic exocrine changes (73.3% versus 36.9%, p<0.0001) were more common in type 1 diabetes donors than controls.

However, early diagnosis and proper treatment are vital to reduce the high morbidity and mortality rates associated with HHS. We describe a male patient who presented with polydipsia, polyuria, and a drowsy mental status. His initial biochemistry results demonstrated severe hyperglycemia (1,456 mg/dL), hyperosmolarity of 359 mOsm/kg (effective osmolarity, 323 mOsm/kg), and mild acidosis (venous pH, 7.327). The patient was diagnosed with HHS and T1DM based on the presence of hyperosmolarity, hyperglycemia, and positivity for antiglutamic acid antibodies. Intensive intravenous fluid and regular insulin (0.025 units/kg/hr) were administered. After hydration and insulin treatment, the patient's mental status and serum glucose and sodium levels improved, and no neurological complications were observed. In summary, most cases of HHS are observed in adult patients with type 2 diabetes. However, occurrences in children and adolescents with T1DM have also been reported.

Pembrolizumab is a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody, which acts against programmed cell death (PD)-1 receptors to help restore the body's T-cell and immune response. CASE REPORT In this case, we present a 51-year-old woman with a past medical history of lung adenocarcinoma and triple-positive breast cancer who was actively receiving therapy with pembrolizumab. Following her second chemotherapy cycle, she developed a severe case of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), with concern for new-onset autoimmune type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), secondary to her recent ICI therapy. The patient was initiated on a high-dose insulin infusion for rapid glycemic control and was successfully transitioned to a subcutaneous regimen approximately 24 h after presentation. She additionally developed other autoimmune-related complications, including hepatoxicity, duodenitis, and a maculopapular rash, which all resolved upon discontinuation of the ICI treatment. Her laboratory test results were consistent with positive anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (anti-GAD) antibodies and undetectable c-peptides, illustrating the uniqueness of an ICI potentially precipitating an autoimmune T1DM. CONCLUSIONS Immune-related adverse events from ICI therapy warrant further investigation to acknowledge the risk of potentially life-threatening adverse reactions, such as the development of DKA. Patients receiving ICI therapy should be educated on signs and symptoms of hyperglycemia, and routine measurements of blood glucose levels should be completed during each chemotherapy cycle. Future research in assessing potential biomarkers of beta cell dysfunction, such as anti-GAD antibodies and c-peptides, is of interest, particularly for patients receiving ICI therapies."

Although its precise pathogenic mechanisms are obscure, this disease is widely acknowledged to be precipitated by environmental factors in individuals with genetic susceptibility. To date, the known susceptibility loci, which have mostly been identified by genome-wide association studies, can explain 80%-85% of the heritability of T1DM. Researchers believe that at least a part of its missing genetic component is caused by undetected rare and low-frequency variants. Most common variants have only small to modest effect sizes, which increases the difficulty of dissecting their functions and restricts their potential clinical application. Intriguingly, many studies have indicated that rare and low-frequency variants have larger effect sizes and play more significant roles in susceptibility to common diseases, including T1DM, than common variants do. Therefore, better recognition of rare and low-frequency variants is beneficial for revealing the genetic architecture of T1DM and for providing new and potent therapeutic targets for this disease. Here, we will discuss existing challenges as well as the great significance of this field and review current knowledge of the contributions of rare and low-frequency variants to T1DM."

Results Factor analysis extracted five factors, interpreted as (1) ""weight status factor"" including age, BMI, waist and hip circumferences; (2) ""proatherogenic factor"" that included LDL-cholesterol, non-HDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides; (3) ""metabolic control factor"" including glucose and HbA1c; (4) ""renal marker factor"" with positive loading of urinary albumin excretion rate and negative loading of GFR; and (5) ""antiatherogenic factor"" that included HDL-cholesterol. High AOPP levels were independently predicted by ""proatherogenic"" (OR: 2.32; 95% CI: 1.44-3.71; p < 0.001), ""metabolic control"" (OR: 2.24; 95% CI: 1.35-3.73; p < 0.01), and ""renal marker"" (OR: 1.65; 95% CI: 1.03-2.65; p < 0.05) factors. ""Renal marker factor"" was a significant predictor of PAB (OR: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.34-0.81; p < 0.01). Regarding antioxidative defense markers, reduced SH groups were predicted by ""proatherogenic factor"" (OR: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.34-0.94; p < 0.05), while ""weight status factor"" predicted lower SOD activity (OR: 1.66; 95% CI: 1.03-2.67; p < 0.05). Conclusions Cardiometabolic risk factors and renal function are associated with oxidative stress in pediatric T1DM patients."

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted on children age 6 to 19 years who are diagnosed with T1DM, and examined the effect of adding Metformin to standard insulin therapy. We performed literature searches on Ovid Midline, Ovid Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) from the date of inception of the database to February 15, 2016. Two reviewers screened titles and abstracts independently, assessed full text eligibility, and extracted information from eligible trials. The primary outcome is glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and the secondary outcomes are health-related quality of life, body mass index (BMI), lipid profile, total insulin daily dose, hypoglycaemia, and diabetes ketoacidosis. We screened 736 studies, and included 6 RCTs with 325 patients. All RCTs were of low risk of bias, and included adolescents (mean age 15 years). The meta-analysis showed that the addition of Metformin resulted in decreased total insulin daily dose (TIDD) (unit/kg/d) (mean difference [MD] = -0.15, 95%CI, -0.24, -0.06), and reduced BMI kg/m<sup>2</sup> (MD -1.46, 95%CI -2.54, 0.38), and BMI z-score (MD= - 0.11, 95%CI -0.21, -0.01), and similar HbA1c (%) (MD= - 0.05, 95%CI, -0.19, 0.29). The overall evidence quality was high to moderate. Current evidence does not support use of Metformin in T1DM adolescents to improve HbA1c. However, Metformin may provide modest reduction in TIDD and BMI."

We carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate whether peripheral levels of pro-inflammatory markers such as interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) is significantly different among patients with or without T1DM, in gender, management of the T1DM, detection in several biological fluids, study design, age range, and glycated hemoglobin. We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus databases, and 26 relevant studies (2186 with T1DM, 2047 controls) were included. We evaluated the studies' quality using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Meta-analyses were conducted, and heterogeneity and publication bias were examined. Compared with controls, IL-1β determined by immunoassays (pooled standardized mean difference (SMD): 2.45, 95% CI = 1.73 to 3.17; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) was significantly elevated in T1DM.

T1DM is the result of an irreversible destruction of pancreatic β-cells, inevitably leading individuals to chronic exogenous insulin dependence. The prevalence of depression among T1DM is common and affects both the progression and management of the disease. The aim of this study is to present the depressive symptoms in people with T1DM who apply and those who do not apply the insulin pump therapy method and to highlight differences in terms of gender and age. The literature review was conducted using the databases PubMed, Science-Direct and Scopus. The inclusion criteria were the following: the studies had to be conducted in T1DM patients, study depressive symptomatology, the number of participants in the studies to be more than 70 people and to be in English. Initially, 464 articles were retrieved and 11 articles met the requirements for inclusion in the systematic review. The results of the systematic review, excluding paediatric patients with T1DM, showed that patients who apply the insulin pump therapy method were more likely to have higher prevalence and intensity of depressive symptoms, compared to users of multiple daily injections. Respectively, increased depressive symptoms in women with T1DM were presented, regardless of the method of treatment. Factors that mediate this difference in depressive symptoms are the sense of freedom and flexibility in lifestyle, fewer dietary restrictions, the sense of constant ""bonding"" and social stigma. Finally, mental health professionals should frequently evaluate the depressive symptoms of the T1DM patients, as it has a direct impact on the development and management of the disease."

Although bone mass is reduced, bone quality is also dramatically altered in this disorder. However, recent evidences suggest a beneficial effect of the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) pathways on bone quality. The aims of the present study were to conduct a comprehensive investigation of bone strength at the organ and tissue level; and to ascertain whether enzyme resistant GIP or GLP-1 mimetic could be beneficial in preventing bone fragility in type 1 diabetes mellitus. Streptozotocin-treated mice were used as a model of type 1 diabetes mellitus. Control and streptozotocin-diabetic animals were treated for 21 days with an enzymatic-resistant GIP peptide ([D-Ala(2) ]GIP) or with liraglutide (each at 25 nmol/kg bw, ip). Bone quality was assessed at the organ and tissue level by microCT, qXRI, 3-point bending, qBEI, nanoindentation, and Fourier-transform infrared microspectroscopy. [D-Ala2]GIP and liraglutide treatment did prevent loss of whole bone strength and cortical microstructure in the STZ-injected mice. However, tissue material properties were significantly improved in STZ-injected animals following treatment with [D-Ala2]GIP or liraglutide. Treatment of STZ-diabetic mice with [D-Ala(2) ]GIP or liraglutide was capable of significantly preventing deterioration of the quality of the bone matrix. Further studies are required to further elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved and to validate whether these findings can be translated to human patients."

The strongest predictor of diabetes complications is glycaemic control and achieving HbA1c ≤ 7.0% is the primary management target. However, standard treatment appears to be lacking and adjunctive strategies require consideration. A systematic review was conducted to examine the effect of low-carbohydrate diets on type 1 diabetes management. Four databases were searched from inception until 28 March 2017: MEDLINE; CINAHL; Cochrane Library; and EMBASE. All primary studies containing a methods section (excluding cross-sectional) were included. Reports had to quantitatively measure the effect(s) of a dietary intervention or observed intake over at least two weeks where carbohydrate is below 45% total energy in adults and/or children with type 1 diabetes. The primary outcome was HbA1c and secondary outcomes were severe hypoglycaemia, total daily insulin, BMI, quality of life and mean daily glucose. Seventy-nine full-text articles were assessed for eligibility and nine were included (two randomised controlled trials, four pre-post interventions, two case-series, one case-report). Eight studies reported a mean change in HbA1c with a low-carbohydrate diet. Of these, four reported a non-significant change (P ≥ 0.05) and three reported statistically significant reductions (P < 0.05). Two studies reported severe hypoglycaemia, five reported total insulin, three reported BMI, and one reported blood glucose. Due to the significant heterogeneity of included studies, an overall effect could not be determined. This review presents all available evidence on low-carbohydrate diets for type 1 diabetes and suggests an urgent need for more primary studies."

However, to date, no conventional intervention has successfully treated the disease. The optimal therapeutic method for T1DM should effectively control the autoimmunity, restore immune homeostasis, preserve residual β-cells, reverse β-cell destruction, and protect the regenerated insulin-producing cells against re-attack. Umbilical cord blood is rich in regulatory T (T(reg)) cells and multiple types of stem cells that exhibit immunomodulating potential and hold promise in their ability to restore peripheral tolerance towards pancreatic islet β-cells through remodeling of immune responses and suppression of autoreactive T cells. Recently, reinfusion of autologous umbilical cord blood or immune cells from cord blood has been proposed as a novel therapy for T1DM, with the advantages of no risk to the donors, minimal ethical concerns, a low incidence of graft-versus-host disease and easy accessibility.

However, the detection and diagnosis of CKD are often delayed because of its asymptomatic nature. In addition, patients often tend to bypass the traditional urine protein (urinary albumin)-based CKD detection test. Even though disease detection using machine learning (ML) is a well-established field of study, it is rarely used to diagnose CKD in T1DM patients. This research aimed to employ and evaluate several ML algorithms to develop models to quickly predict CKD in patients with T1DM using easily available routine checkup data. This study analyzed 16 years of data of 1375 T1DM patients, obtained from the Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC) clinical trials directed by the National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive, and Kidney Diseases, USA. Three data imputation techniques (RF, KNN, and MICE) and the SMOTETomek resampling technique were used to preprocess the primary dataset. Ten ML algorithms including logistic regression (LR), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), Gaussian naïve Bayes (GNB), support vector machine (SVM), stochastic gradient descent (SGD), decision tree (DT), gradient boosting (GB), random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), and light gradient-boosted machine (LightGBM) were applied to developed prediction models. Each model included 19 demographic, medical history, behavioral, and biochemical features, and every feature's effect was ranked using three feature ranking techniques (XGB, RF, and Extra Tree). Lastly, each model's ROC, sensitivity (recall), specificity, accuracy, precision, and F-1 score were estimated to find the best-performing model. The RF classifier model exhibited the best performance with 0.96 (±0.01) accuracy, 0.98 (±0.01) sensitivity, and 0.93 (±0.02) specificity. LightGBM performed second best and was quite close to RF with 0.95 (±0.06) accuracy. In addition to these two models, KNN, SVM, DT, GB, and XGB models also achieved more than 90% accuracy."
