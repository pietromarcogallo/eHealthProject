Hypertension was induced with 40 mg/kg body weight (b.w.) of N omega-nitro-L-arginine-methyl (L-NAME) administered orally. Dyslipidemia was induced by the administration of a diet with a high cholesterol (2%) content. Diabetes mellitus was induced by intraperitoneal administration of a single dose of streptozocin (65 mg/kg). Malondialdehyde (MDA) and total oxidative status (TOS) are increased by all three cardiovascular risk factors (up to 207%). The indirect assessment of NO synthesis (NOx) is observed to be reduced after L-NAME administration (43%), and dyslipidemia induction (16%), while type 1 diabetes mellitus is associated with the highest levels of NOx (increased 112%). Hypertension, dyslipidemia, and type 1 diabetes reduced the total antioxidative capacity (TAC) and total thiol (SH) levels (up to 57%). The values of evaluated pro-inflammatory cytokines, tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-1β (IL-1β), assessed from the ascending aorta were elevated by all three cardiovascular risk factors, with the highest levels induced by type 1 diabetes mellitus (up to 259%). The histopathological examination of the ascending and descending aorta revealed reversible pro-atherogenic changes consisting of the accumulation of lipid droplets in the subendothelial connective tissue on rats with hypertension and dyslipidemia. Irreversible pro-atherogenic changes consisting of a reduction of the specific elasticity of the arteries were observed in rats with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Type 1 diabetes mellitus demonstrates an alteration of the oxidative stress parameters, the elevation of tissue levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines and causing irreversible pro-atherogenic changes on the aortic wall."

Lithium, a first-line therapy for bipolar disorder, has become an attractive agent for attenuating peripheral neuropathy and menopause-induced bone loss. Therefore, our aim was to determine the effect of chronic lithium treatment on mechanical hypersensitivity and trabecular bone loss induced by T1DM in mice. T1DM was induced in male C57BL/6J mice by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ, 50 mg/kg/day, for 5 consecutive days). 12 weeks after T1DM-induction, mice received a daily intraperitoneal injection of vehicle, 30 or 60 mg/kg lithium (as LiCl) for 6 weeks. Throughout the treatment period, blood glucose levels and mechanical sensitivity were evaluated every 2 weeks. After lithium treatment, the femur and L5 vertebra were harvested for microcomputed tomography (microCT) analysis. T1DM mice showed significant hyperglycemia, mechanical hypersensitivity, and significant trabecular bone loss as compared with the control group. Chronic lithium treatment did not revert the hindpaw mechanical hypersensitivity nor hyperglycemia associated to T1DM induced by STZ. In contrast, microCT analysis revealed that lithium reverted, in a dose-dependent manner, the loss of trabecular bone associated to T1DM induced by STZ at both the distal femur and L5 vertebra. Lithium treatment by itself did not affect any trabecular bone parameter in non-diabetic mice."

While current knowledge regarding the molecules related to the pathogenesis and diagnosis of T1DM is vast, the discovery of new molecules, such as micro ribonucleic acids (micro-RNAs, miRNAs), as well as their interactions with T1DM, has spurred novel prospects in the diagnosis of the disease. This review aims at summarizing current knowledge regarding miRNAs' biosynthesis and action pathways and their role as gene expression regulators in T1DM. MiRNAs follow a complex biosynthesis pathway, including cleaving and transport from nucleus to cytoplasm. After assembly of their final form, they inhibit translation or cause messenger RNA (mRNA) degradation, resulting in the obstruction of protein synthesis. Many studies have reported miRNA involvement in T1DM pathogenesis, mainly through interference with pancreatic b-cell function, insulin production and secretion. They are also found to contribute to β-cell destruction, as they aid in the production of autoreactive agents. Due to their elevated accumulation in various biological specimens, as well as their involvement in T1DM pathogenesis, their role as biomarkers in early preclinical T1DM diagnosis is widely hypothesized, with future studies concerning their diagnostic value deemed a necessity."

We investigated associations between cfPWV and renal outcomes, cardiovascular events, and all-cause mortality in people with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Methods and Results cfPWV was measured with SphygmoCor in 633 people with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Median (interquartile range) follow-up was 6.2 (5.8-6.7) years. End points included progression in albuminuria group, decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥30%, end-stage kidney disease, cardiovascular event, mortality, and a composite renal end point. Hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated per 1-SD increase in cfPWV. Adjustments included age, sex, hemoglobin A1c, mean arterial pressure, body mass index, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking, urine albumin excretion rate, and eGFR. The cohort included 45% women, mean (SD) age was 54 (13) years, mean (SD) eGFR was 83.2 (27.9) mL/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, and mean (SD) cfPWV was 10.4 (3.3) m/s. Median (interquartile range) albumin excretion rate was 17 (17-63) mg/24 h. After adjustment, higher cfPWV was associated with increased hazard of progression in albuminuria (HR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.10-2.32); decline in eGFR ≥30% (HR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.06-1.79); cardiovascular event (HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.01-1.70); mortality (HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.00-1.85); and the composite renal end point (HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.04-1.63), but not with end-stage kidney disease (HR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.62-2.26). Higher cfPWV was associated with steeper yearly increase in albumin excretion and steeper yearly decline in eGFR after adjustment (<i>P</i>=0.002 and <i>P</i>=0.01, respectively). Conclusions cfPWV was associated with increased hazard of renal outcomes, cardiovascular event, and mortality. cfPWV may be suited for risk stratification in type 1 diabetes mellitus."

It is known that one of the main manifestations of brain damage in type 1 diabetes is cognitive impairment, which is possibly associated with the peculiarities of vascularization and interhemispheric asymmetry, which requires in-depth analysis using modern neuroimaging methods. The aim of the study is to assess the symmetry of structural, metabolic and neurovascularization changes in the brain in patients with type 1 diabetes and cognitive impairment. The study included 120 patients with type 1 diabetes aged 18 to 45 years suffering from cognitive impairment, and 30 people without cognitive decline and the control group (n=30) healthy people without diabetes. Neuropsychological testing included the Montreal Cognitive Dysfunction Assessment Scale (MoCA test). For neuroimaging methods, standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), contrast and non-contrast-enhanced perfusion were used. Statistical processing was carried out using the SPSS Statistic 2020 software. In patients with type 1 diabetes with cognitive impairment, as manifested by impaired memory and/or attention, perfusion imaging revealed the presence of brain asymmetry zones. Standard MRI allowed to demonstrate changes in the white, gray matter and hippocampus in the right hemisphere. The results obtained were refined taking into account the topical localization, so during the perfusion study, regions with asymmetric blood flow were identified - namely, the white matter of the frontal lobe and the gray matter in the occipital lobe. Spectroscopy of the brain revealed that it was in these areas of the brain that the most significant metabolic disorders were noted - in the form of significantly altered ratio of N-acetylaspartate (NAA)/choline (Cho) on the left, along with the asymmetry in phosphocreatine level (Cr 2) on the right. In conclusion, early preclinical predictive diagnostics with the use of modern neuroimaging methods allows for timely detection of impaired vascularization and brain metabolism in this group of patients, However, decreased perfusion in the region within the region of frontal lobe white matter and temporal lobe grey matter, and hippocampal cell metabolism by spectra should be highlighted among the parameters Cr right and NAA/Cho left."

29504478,Targeting dysfunctional beta-cell signaling for the potential treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus.,['Diabetes'],"['Rachel J Fenske', 'Michelle E Kimple']","Since its discovery and purification by Frederick Banting in 1921, exogenous insulin has remained almost the sole therapy for type 1 diabetes mellitus. While insulin alleviates the primary dysfunction of the disease, many other aspects of the pathophysiology of type 1 diabetes mellitus are unaffected. Research aimed towards the discovery of novel type 1 diabetes mellitus therapeutics targeting different cell signaling pathways is gaining momentum. The focus of these efforts has been almost entirely on the impact of immunomodulatory drugs, particularly those that have already received FDA-approval for other autoimmune diseases. However, these drugs can often have severe side effects, while also putting already immunocompromised individuals at an increased risk for other infections. Potential therapeutic targets in the insulin-producing beta-cell have been largely ignored by the type 1 diabetes mellitus field, save the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor. While there is preliminary evidence to support the clinical exploration of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor-based drugs as type 1 diabetes mellitus adjuvant therapeutics, there is a vast space for other putative therapeutic targets to be explored. The alpha subunit of the heterotrimeric G<sub>z</sub> protein (Gα<sub>z</sub>) has been shown to promote beta-cell inflammation, dysfunction, death, and failure to replicate in the context of diabetes in a number of mouse models. Genetic loss of Gα<sub>z</sub> or inhibition of the Gα<sub>z</sub> signaling pathway through dietary interventions is protective against the development of insulitis and hyperglycemia. The multifaceted effects of Gα<sub>z</sub> in regards to beta-cell health in the context of diabetes make it an ideal therapeutic target for further study. It is our belief that a low-risk, effective therapy for type 1 diabetes mellitus will involve a multidimensional approach targeting a number of regulatory systems, not the least of which is the insulin-producing beta-cell. Impact statement The expanding investigation of beta-cell therapeutic targets for the treatment and prevention of type 1 diabetes mellitus is fundamentally relevant and timely. This review summarizes the overall scope of research into novel type 1 diabetes mellitus therapeutics, highlighting weaknesses or caveats in current clinical trials as well as describing potential new targets to pursue. More specifically, signaling proteins that act as modulators of beta-cell function, survival, and replication, as well as immune infiltration may need to be targeted to develop the most efficient pharmaceutical interventions for type 1 diabetes mellitus. One such beta-cell signaling pathway, mediated by the alpha subunit of the heterotrimeric G<sub>z</sub> protein (Gα<sub>z</sub>), is discussed in more detail. The work described here will be critical in moving the field forward as it emphasizes the central role of the beta-cell in type 1 diabetes mellitus disease pathology."

The objective of the present study was to explore other potential indications for ONO-4641 based on its immunomodulatory effects. ONO-4641 was tested in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, an animal model of spontaneous type 1 diabetes mellitus, an autoimmune disease with unmet medical needs. ONO-4641 at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg prevented the onset of diabetes mellitus in NOD mice. Furthermore, ONO-4641 at doses of 0.03 and 0.1 mg/kg decreased diabetic prevalence in NOD mice after the onset of diabetes mellitus in a dose-dependent manner. Histopathological analysis demonstrated that insulin-positive areas in the islets of mice administered 0.03 and 0.1 mg/kg ONO-4641 showed a tendency of high values although they were not significantly different from the Control group, which was treated with vehicle. These observations suggest ONO-4641 may delay the onset and progression of type 1 diabetes mellitus."

Recent scientific reports suggest that people with type 1 diabetes mellitus also develop insulin resistance, which is generally considered to be a distinctive feature of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The causes of insulin resistance in type 1 diabetes mellitus were explored, but there was a lack of publications that connected the risk factors of insulin resistance in type 1 diabetes mellitus with the proposition of repair mechanisms that are offered by quaternary prevention. Toward this end, the present review is an attempt to combine the previous reports on the causes of insulin resistance in type 1 diabetes mellitus and a brief review of quaternary prevention. The destructive effect of insulin resistance on many physiological processes that predisposes the individual to chronic diabetes complications creates an urgent need to introduce effective therapeutic methods for preventing the development and progression of this pathology."

Nivolumab, an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, blocks PD-1 and can restore anti-cancer immune responses by disrupting the signal that inhibits T-cell activation. Nivolumab may induce endocrine-related adverse events, including hypophysitis, autoimmune thyroiditis, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. Here we report a 68-year-old female patient with advanced renal cell carcinoma who was treated with nivolumab. She had positive anti-thyroglobulin antibodies and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies with slightly elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (9.048 μU/mL), and was diagnosed as chronic thyroiditis with subclinical hypothyroidism before nivolumab therapy. She developed painless thyroiditis after the first cycle of the therapy (Day 14). At the 7th cycle of nivolumab therapy (Day 98), hyperglycemia (473 mg/dL) was noted, whereas glycated hemoglobin level was 6.9%. Islet-related autoantibodies were all negative. The glucagon tolerance test showed complete depletion of insulin. Human leukocyte antigen typing showed haplotype DRB1*09:01-DQB1*03:03, which was reported to be closely associated with type 1 diabetes mellitus in Japan. Fulminant type 1 diabetes mellitus was diagnosed, and she was immediately treated with multiple daily injections of insulin. Fulminant type 1 diabetes mellitus is characterized by rapid-onset diabetic ketoacidosis, and negative islet-related autoantibodies, and was proposed as a novel subtype of non-autoimmune diabetes. Preceding painless thyroiditis with positive thyroid autoantibodies observed in the present case, however, raises the possibility that autoimmune mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of nivolumab-induced fulminant type 1 diabetes mellitus."

Hence, suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress may ameliorate or decrease the severity of diabetes mellitus. To investigate the effect and mechanism(s) of action of RVD1, an anti-inflammatory metabolite derived from docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), on STZ-induced type 1 DM in male Wistar rats, type 1 diabetes was induced by single intraperitoneal (i.p) streptozotocin (STZ-65 mg/kg) injection. RVD1 (60 ng/mL, given intraperitoneally) was administered from day 1 along with STZ for five consecutive days. Plasma glucose, IL-6, TNF-α, BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor that has anti-diabetic actions), LXA4 (lipoxin A4), and RVD1 levels and BDNF concentrations in the pancreas, liver, and brain tissues were measured. Apoptotic (<i>Bcl2/Bax</i>), inflammatory (<i>COX-1/COX-2/Nf-κb/iNOS/PPAR-γ</i>) genes and downstream insulin signaling proteins (Gsk-3β/Foxo1) were measured in the pancreatic tissue along with concentrations of various antioxidants and lipid peroxides. RVD1 decreased severity of STZ-induced type 1 DM by restoring altered plasma levels of TNF-α, IL-6, and BDNF (<i>p</i> < 0.001); expression of pancreatic <i>COX-1/COX-2/PPAR-γ</i> genes and downstream insulin signaling proteins (Gsk-3β/Foxo1) and the concentrations of antioxidants and lipid peroxides to near normal. RVD1 treatment restored expression of <i>Bcl2/Pdx</i> genes, plasma LXA4 (<i>p</i> < 0.001) and RVD1 levels and increased brain, pancreatic, intestine, and liver BDNF levels to near normal. The results of the present study suggest that RVD1 can prevent STZ-induced type 1 diabetes by its anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant actions and by activating the <i>Pdx</i> gene that is needed for pancreatic β cell proliferation."

Whether exposure to PAHs is associated with the incidence of type 1 diabetes mellitus should be investigated. To this end, pregnant mice were exposed to mixed PAHs (5, 50, or 500 μg/kg) once every other day during gestation. The adult male offspring displayed impaired glucose tolerance and reduced serum levels of glucagon and insulin. Immunohistochemical staining revealed increased numbers of apoptotic β-cells and a reduced β-cell mass in these males. The downregulated expression of pancreatic estrogen receptor α, androgen receptor, and transcription factor PDX1 was responsible for impacting β-cell development. The relatively reduced α-cell area was associated with downregulated ARX expression. The transcription of Isn2 and Gcg in pancreatic tissue was downregulated, which indicated that the function of β-cells and α-cells was impaired. Methylation levels in the Isn2 promotor were significantly elevated in mice prenatally exposed to 500 µg/kg PAHs, which was consistent with the change in its mRNA levels. The number of macrophages infiltrating islets was significantly increased, indicating that prenatal PAH exposure might reduce islet cell numbers in an autoimmune manner.

It is a significant global health problem as the incidence of this disorder is increasing worldwide. The causes are still poorly understood, although it certainly has genetic and environmental origins. Vitamin D formed profusely in the skin upon exposure to sunlight, as well as from dietary sources, exhibits an immunomodulatory effect based on gene transcription control. Indeed, vitamin D can downregulate mechanisms connected with adaptive immunity, induce immunological tolerance and decrease auto-aggression-related inflammation. These properties provide the basis for a preventive and therapeutic role of vitamin D. As many studies have demonstrated, appropriate supplementation with vitamin D reduces the risk of autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes mellitus, and alleviates disease symptoms in patients. The aim of this narrative review is to present the molecular mechanisms for the vitamin D immunomodulatory effect as well as review human clinical studies on the use of vitamin D as adjuvant therapy in type 1 diabetes mellitus."

Its most important immunologic markers are pancreatic beta-cell autoantibodies. This study aimed to determine diabetes mellitus antibodies frequency among children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes. Methods This descriptive study evaluated the frequency of four diabetes autoantibodies (glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 autoantibodies [GADA], islet cell autoantibodies [ICA], insulin autoantibodies [IAA], tyrosine phosphatase-like insulinoma antigen-2 antibodies [IA-2A]) and their serum level in children and adolescents diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus at the diabetes department of Bou-Ali-Sina Hospital and Baghban Clinic, Sari, Iran, from March 2012 to March 2018. The relationship between the level of different antibodies and age, gender, and diabetes duration were determined. A two-sided p value less than 0.05 indicated statistical significance. Results One hundred forty-two eligible patient records were screened. The average age at diabetes diagnosis was 4.2 ± 4.4 years. The median duration of diabetes was 34.0 (12.7-69.7) months. 53.5% of patients were female, and 81.7% of them had at least one positive autoantibody, and ICA in 66.2%, GADA in 56.3%, IA-2A in 40.1%, and IAA in 21.8% were positive. The type of the autoantibodies and their serum level was similar between females and males but there was a higher rate of positive autoantibodies in females. The level of IA-2A and ICA were in positive and weak correlation with age at diagnosis. Conclusions More than 80% of pediatric and adolescent patients with type 1 diabetes were autoantibody-positive. ICA and GADA were the most frequently detected autoantibodies. The presence of antibodies was significantly higher in females."

This study aims to explore the underlying molecular mechanism of resveratrol in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) through microRNA (miR)-129-containing extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) based on <i>in silico</i> analysis. The rat model of T1DM was established by intraperitoneal injection of sodium citrate containing streptozotocin, and the wound was made around the deep fascia. Rat MSCs were isolated and treated with resveratrol (SRT501), and the corresponding EVs (SRT501-EVs) were isolated, where the expression of miR-129 was determined. By performing function experiments, the effect of SRT501-EVs and miR-129 on the biological functions of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was determined. Finally, the binding relationship between miR-129 and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) was also determined by the dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. miR-129 was shown as a candidate related to both resveratrol and wound healing in T1DM. SRT501-EVs promoted the skin wound healing of T1DM rats and also further improved the proliferative, migratory, and tube formation potentials of HUVECs. Resveratrol inhibited the expression of TRAF6 in HUVECs stimulated by MSC-conditioned medium and promoted the transfer of miR-129 <i>via</i> EVs, while TRAF6 was confirmed as a target gene of miR-129. Furthermore, inhibition of miR-129 attenuated the proangiogenic effect of resveratrol on HUVECs. Resveratrol exerts promotive role in wound healing in T1DM through downregulation of TRAF6 <i>via</i> MSC-EV-carried miR-129, suggesting a regulatory network involved in the wound healing process in T1DM."

Here, we present a case of fulminant type 1 diabetes mellitus where the patient was initially misdiagnosed with gastroenteritis and acute pancreatitis. A 50-year-old Japanese woman was referred to our hospital with coma and shock. She had presented with nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and thirst from 5 days before admission, and had been misdiagnosed with gastroenteritis by her primary care physician. Upon examination, metabolic acidosis and remarkable elevation of pancreatic exocrine enzymes were found (amylase 4322 IU/L, lipase 1046 IU/L). Acute pancreatitis was initially suspected because of the high pancreatic enzyme levels and abdominal pain. However, her plasma glucose level was markedly elevated at 1357 mg/dL. The patient was diagnosed with fulminant type 1 diabetes mellitus. Computed tomography showed no radiological evidence of acute pancreatitis. In conclusion, fulminant type 1 diabetes mellitus is often referred to hospital with flu-like or gastrointestinal symptoms and elevation of serum pancreatic enzymes.

This longitudinal study included 1177 participants (526 with type 1 diabetes mellitus [T1DM] and 651 without) from the Coronary Artery Calcification in Type 1 Diabetes study. Dietary assessment and anthropometric and biochemical measurements were assessed at baseline and 14-year follow-up. MetS status was defined using the Harmonization criteria. EDIP scores were computed based on a food frequency questionnaire. Generalized linear mixed models were applied and subgroup analyses were performed by diabetes status. Mean age of study participants was 38 years and 48% were male at baseline. EDIP was positively associated with MetS (β<sub>T3 versus T1</sub>=0.81, P < .01) in T1DM but not in nondiabetic controls. Of the MetS components, low HDL-C and hypertriglyceridemia had positive associations with EDIP in both groups. Individuals with T1DM consumed more pro-inflammatory diets and had a greater risk of developing MetS than those without diabetes. The consumption of processed meat, red meat, high- and low- energy beverages was significantly higher in those with MetS than those without this condition (all P < .05). Reduced consumption of pro-inflammatory foods such as processed meat, red meat, sugar-sweetened beverages, and diet drinks may lower MetS risk in T1DM."

In addition to well-established pathogenic effector T cells, regulatory T cells (Tregs) have also been shown to be defective in T1D. Thus, an increasing number of therapeutic approaches are being developed to target Tregs. However, the role and mechanisms of TGF-β-induced Tregs (iTregs) in T1D remain poorly understood. Here, using a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced preclinical T1D mouse model, we found that iTregs could ameliorate the development of T1D and preserve β cell function. The preventive effect was associated with the inhibition of type 1 cytotoxic T (Tc1) cell function and rebalancing the Treg/Tc1 cell ratio in recipients. Furthermore, we showed that the underlying mechanisms were due to the TGF-β-mediated combinatorial actions of mTOR and TCF1. In addition to the preventive role, the therapeutic effects of iTregs on the established STZ-T1D and nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse models were tested, which revealed improved β cell function. Our findings therefore provide key new insights into the basic mechanisms involved in the therapeutic role of iTregs in T1D."

The classic view is that autoreactive T cells mistakenly destroy healthy ('innocent') β-cells. We propose an alternative view in which the β-cell is the key contributor to the disease. By their nature and function, β-cells are prone to biosynthetic stress with limited measures for self-defence. β-Cell stress provokes an immune attack that has considerable negative effects on the source of a vital hormone. This view would explain why immunotherapy at best delays progression of type 1 diabetes mellitus and points to opportunities to use therapies that revitalize β-cells, in combination with immune intervention strategies, to reverse the disease. We present the case that dysfunction occurs in both the immune system and β-cells, which provokes further dysfunction, and present the evidence leading to the consensus that islet autoimmunity is an essential component in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes mellitus. Next, we build the case for the β-cell as the trigger of an autoimmune response, supported by analogies in cancer and antitumour immunity.

In addition, HDPs-2A up-regulated PDX-1, activated and up-regulated IRS2 expression, and regulated apoptosis and regeneration of islet β cells to recover islet β-cell function injury in TIDM rats. HDPs-2A also up-regulated the expression of pancreatic GK and GLUT2 to improve insulin secretion ability of islet β-cells, ultimately improving the glucose metabolism disorder of T1DM rats. Moreover, HDPs-2A significantly up-regulated the expression of GK and down-regulated the expression of G6Pase in liver to improve liver glycogen synthesis, inhibit liver gluconiogenesis, and improve liver glucose metabolism disorder of T1DM rats. In summary, the hypoglycemic mechanisms of HDPs-2A may include regulating the regeneration and apoptosis of islet β-cells and activating liver glycometabolism-related signaling pathways in T1DM rats."

Previous studies showed that DIHS is associated with the onset of fulminant type 1 diabetes mellitus (FT1D). Although genetic background and abnormalities in immune response or viral infection are considered to be associated with pathogenesis of FT1D, it remains unclear whether virus infection and specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing are involved in DIHS-associated FT1D. Here, we report a case of a 78-year-old female patient with FT1D after DIHS treatment. She was diagnosed as DIHS caused by carbamazepine, and treatment with predonisolone was initiated. After 46 days from the occurrence of DIHS, she was admitted to our hospital because of type 1 diabetes mellitus and diabetic ketoacidosis. Although her Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was elevated by predonisolone treatment (HbA1c: 9.2%), we diagnosed her as fulminant type 1 diabetes mellitus considering the abrupt onset of the ketoacidosis. Her general condition was improved by treatment with fluid infusion and insulin administration. During her clinical course, the infection of coxsackie B4 virus was observed. In addition, the examination of HLA typing showed HLA-A24 haplotype. These findings suggest that the coxsackie B4 virus infection may be involved in the pathogenesis of DIHS-induced FT1D, and that HLA-A24 haplotype might relate to DIHS-associated FT1D."

APS3 is rare, and its pathogenesis is unclear. We describe a female patient with APS3 whose human leukocyte antigen (HLA) type could provide a clue to the pathogenesis of APS3. CASE REPORT A 40-year-old Japanese female patient who had been diagnosed with MG at 5 years of age, and which had been treated with cholinesterase inhibitors, was referred to our hospital with thirst, polydipsia, polyuria, weight loss, and hyperglycemia. She was found to have type 1 diabetes mellitus based on laboratory tests. She was also positive for anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody and was thus diagnosed with Hashimoto disease. This combination of type 1 diabetes mellitus, myasthenia gravis, and Hashimoto disease led to a diagnosis of APS3. Her HLA serotype was A24; B46/54; DR4/9; DQ8/9, and genotype was A*24: 02; B*46: 01: 01/54: 01: 01; C*01: 02; DRB1*04: 06/09: 01: 02; DQB1*03: 02: 01/03: 03: 02; and DQA1*03: 01/03: 02: 01. We subsequently reviewed 10 cases of APS3 combined with MG, including the present case and cases reported in Japanese. This review revealed that HLA-DR9/DQ9 might be a specific HLA subtype associated with APS3 with MG. Four of the 10 cases had MG diagnosed before diabetes mellitus and autoimmune thyroid disease. CONCLUSIONS The present case showed that, in people with HLA-B46 and -DR9, antibody-negative MG can precede the development of APS3 by many years. Physicians should consider the possibility of APS3 when evaluating patients with ocular-type myasthenia gravis, and screen them for type 1 diabetes."

Microbiome modulated by antibiotics seems to serve as one of the environmental factors which could influence the development of T1DM. Mitochondria, as autochthonous environmental bacteria living in our cells, and other bacteria share many common enzymes including beta-lactamases and it is supported by evidence that some beta-lactamase inhibitors are able to interact with counterpart enzymes. Thus, antibiotics may utilize two different pathways influencing the development of T1DM; one through modulation of microbiome and a second one via the interaction of mitochondrial enzymes. Data of consumption of penicillin (both narrow and broad spectrum) and beta-lactamase inhibitors in 30 European countries were collected from the database of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. These data were correlated with the prevalence reported by the International Diabetes Federation (2019) referring to type 1 diabetes in Europe. No correlation was found between total penicillin consumption or use of broad spectrum penicillin and the prevalence of type 1 diabetes. Nevertheless, broad spectrum penicillin, in combination with beta-lactamase inhibitor, was in inverse correlation with the prevalence of type 1 diabetes (r = - 0.573, p = 0.001). On the other hand, narrow spectrum penicillin was in positive correlation with type 1 diabetes (r = 0.523, p = 0.003). Prevalence of type 1 diabetes showed an inverse correlation with the use of beta-lactamase inhibitors and a positive one with that of narrow spectrum penicillin. Such a detailed analysis has not so far been provided referring to the penicillin group. In the background of this association either microbiomal or direct mitochondrial effects can be supposed."

Zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8), a novel islet autoantigen, is specifically expressed in insulin-containing secretory granules of β-cells. Genetic studies show that the genotypes of SLC30A8 can determine either protective or diabetogenic response depending on environmental and lifestyle factors. The ZnT8 protein expression, as well as zinc content in β-cells, was decreased in diabetic mice. Thus, ZnT8 might participate in insulin biosynthesis and release, and subsequently involved deteriorated β-cell function through direct or indirect mechanisms in type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus. From a clinical feature standpoint, the prevalence of ZnT8A is gradiently increased in type 2 diabetes mellitus, latent autoimmune diabetes in adults and type 1 diabetes mellitus. The frequency and epitopes of ZnT8-specific T cells and cytokine release by ZnT8-specific T cells are also different in diabetic patients and healthy controls. Additionally, the response to ZnT8 administration is also different in type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus. In the present review, we summarize the literature about clinical aspects of ZnT8 in the pathogenesis of diabetes, and suggest that ZnT8 might play a different role between type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

In that sense, evidence indicates that the anticonvulsant pregabalin is highly effective in treating severe cases of anxiety, as well as PTSD and diabetic neuropathic pain which is also very prevalent in T1DM. Herein, the short- and long-term effects of a single injection of pregabalin on the acquisition of a fear extinction memory and parameters of anxiety in induced-T1DM animals were investigated. For that, we used the contextual fear conditioning (CFC) and elevated plus maze paradigms, respectively. A putative antioxidant activity was also evaluated. Our findings demonstrated that induced-T1DM animals presented greater expression of fear memory, difficulty in extinguishing this fear memory, associated with a more pronounced anxiety-like response. Pregabalin was able to induce a short and long-lasting effect by facilitating the acquisition of the fear extinction memory and inducing a later anxiolytic-like effect. Also, the increased lipid peroxidation levels in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of induced-T1DM rats were reduced after pregabalin injection, while the decreased levels of reduced glutathione were increased in the hippocampus. Despite the need for more studies to understand the mechanism of action of pregabalin under these conditions, our data demonstrate for the first time that a single injection of pregabalin in a specific time window was able to improve behavioral parameters in addition to inducing neuroprotective effect. Thus, pregabalin has potential worth exploring for the treatment of PTSD and/or Anxiety associated with T1DM."

In Japan, FT1DM accounts for approximately 20% of acute-onset adult type 1 diabetes mellitus cases; however, reports of pediatric-onset FT1DM are rare. We aimed to determine the frequency and clinical characteristics of FT1DM in Japanese children and adolescents by conducting a 2-phase questionnaire survey among the members of the Japanese Study Group of Insulin Therapy for Childhood and Adolescent Diabetes (JSGIT) regarding their clinical experience with FT1DM. Responses were obtained from 54 of the 79 participating hospitals (68.4%). Of these, 8 hospitals managed a total of 15 pediatric patients with FT1DM (4 patients in each of 2 hospitals, 2 patients in 1 hospital, and 1 patient in each of 5 hospitals). The distribution of patient age was biphasic, with peaks in children younger than 5 years and older than 8 years of age. The clinical characteristics of FT1DM in this population (such as the duration from onset of symptoms to diagnosis, severity of symptoms, preceding flu-like episodes, and abnormal laboratory data) did not differ from those of patients with adult-onset FT1DM. The frequency of pediatric-onset FT1DM is low compared with that of adult-onset FT1DM. The genetic background and susceptibility patterns of pediatric patients with FT1DM may differ from those typical of adults with FT1DM, but both age groups share similar clinical characteristics."

Methods Forty-one children with T1DM and 41 age- and gender-matched healthy children were included in the study. Demographical characteristics of all cases were examined. In echocardiography; in addition to conventional echocardiographic measurements, end-systolic EATT was measured from right ventricular free wall. In electrocardiogram; Pd, QTd, QTcd and Tp-e interval durations, as well as Tp-e/QT and Tp-e/QTc ratios were calculated. Correlation values between EATT and electrocardiographic parameters were also noted. Results Mean age of the patient group was determined to be 12.43 ± 3.04 years and that of the control group was determined to be 12.08 ± 2.56 years. There was no significant difference between the groups in regard to age, gender, body weight, height and body mass index. In the patient group; EATT, Pd, QTd, QTcd and Tp-e interval were determined to be significantly higher compared to the control group. In the patient group, no significant correlation was determined between EATT and Pd, QTd, QTcd and Tp-e. However, when both patient and control groups were evaluated together, a statistically significant positive correlation was determined between EATT and Pd, QTd, QTcd and Tp-e. Conclusions In children with T1DM, an increase in epicardial adipose tissue thickness and in risk of cardiac arrhythmias has been demonstrated. To reveal the possible unfavorable effects of EATT on cardiac conduction system in T1DM patients needs further studies."

All 3 drugs demonstrated statistically significant reductions in hemoglobin A<sub>1C</sub>, weight, and total daily insulin dose without an increased risk of hypoglycemia in up to 52 weeks of therapy. The incidence of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) was higher in patients on a SGLT inhibitor at all doses, with the exception of empagliflozin 2.5 mg (0.8% vs 1.2% with placebo). <b>Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice:</b> SGLT inhibitors are potential adjuncts to insulin in T1DM patients, providing clinically meaningful benefits. Regulatory bodies have either approved or are reviewing these agents for use in T1DM. Clinicians should be familiar with the DKA risk associated with SGLT inhibitors and utilize DKA risk-mitigation strategies. Empagliflozin 2.5 mg warrants additional investigation given its efficacy without an increased incidence of DKA. <b>Conclusions:</b> Phase 3 trial data of SGLT inhibitors provide evidence for sustained efficacy in T1DM patients. Appropriate patient selection for therapy and routine monitoring are essential to minimize associated risks."

Regarding the speed of β-cell destruction, there are large variations depending on age. In some adult cases, sufficient β-cell function is sometimes retained for a relatively long period and eventually they become dependent on insulin for survival. It is known that even in subjects with T1DM showing high titers of such antibodies, insulin secretory capacity is preserved under several conditions such as ""honeymoon"" period and slowly progressive T1DM (SPIDDM). Herein, we reported the acute onset T1DM subject with long-term preservation of β-cell function, although his anti-GAD antibody and anti-IA-2 antibody titers were very high for more than 4 years. This case is very important in that his β-cell function was preserved with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor alone.

However, direct administration of autoantigens via oral route exhibits a low tolerance-inducing effect as a result of the digestion of protein antigens in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and therefore, a large dosage of autoantigens may be needed. In this study, bacterium-like particles (BLPs) made from food-grade lactic acid bacteria were used to deliver the intracellular domain of the insulinoma-associated protein 2 (IA-2ic). For this purpose, BLPs-IA-2ic vaccine in which IA-2ic bound to the surface of BLPs was constructed.

Medical records of transgender patients were analyzed retrospectively. From January 1, 2007 until October 10, 2016, 1,081 transgender patients presented at a tertiary reference center to start hormonal treatment. Nine of these 1,081 patients were previously diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus and 1 was diagnosed with latent autoimmune diabetes in adults. A 2.3-fold higher prevalence of type 1 diabetes mellitus was observed in transgender patients. We concluded that type 1 diabetes mellitus was more prevalent in transgender patients than one would expect from population prevalences. This could be a spurious result in a local cohort, because a causal relation seems unlikely, but our finding might encourage other centers to investigate this putative association.

We hypothesized that in pediatric patients with DM1, impairment of macrocirculation could be further augmented by a coexisting autoimmune process. Therefore, we investigated the influence of AIT on large arteries in DM1 pediatric patients. Our group consisted of 19 DM1, 19 DM1 + AIT patients and 29 control subjects. The groups were comparable regarding age and gender. The DM1 and DM1 + AIT patients were matched for age at onset of DM1 and diabetes duration. Macrocirculation was described using pulsatility indices (PIs) determined for common carotid (CCA) and peripheral arteries of upper and lower limbs. CCA resistance index (RI) and ABI were also assessed. Children with DM1 + AIT had only significantly lower CCA_PI and CCA_RI in comparison with controls whereas in the absence of AIT such difference was not found. The diabetes duration and age of onset did not correlate with carotid indices. Total cholesterol level was higher both in DM1 + AIT and DM1 groups than in the control group. For low density lipoproteins cholesterol, a significant difference was found between DM1 + AIT and control groups. Age-independent impact of AIT on CCA_PI was confirmed by multivariate analysis.

Presently, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a potential curative therapy for IPEX syndrome, but not for T1D. Generally, after complete loss of pancreatic β-cells, HSCT cannot improve the prognosis of T1D. Here, we report the case of a 16-year-old adolescent with late-onset of FOXP3 R347H mutation associated IPEX syndrome with T1D, where insulin dependency was ameliorated following HSCT. This patient with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus required insulin dosage of 1.28 U/kg/day for 1 month before HSCT. Although the results of glucose homeostasis before HSCT revealed impaired insulin secretion and low ΔC-peptide immunoreactivity (CPR, 1.0 ng/mL), the patient withdrew insulin infusion and remained euglycemic at 15 months after HSCT, and had normal β-cell function with improved ΔCPR (3.4 ng/mL) at 20 months after HSCT. The present case suggests that HSCT for T1D-associated IPEX syndrome improves Treg deficiency and prevents elimination of β-cells. We speculate that the period from the onset of T1D to HSCT could affect the therapeutic efficacy for T1D with IPEX, and early intervention with HSCT before or immediately after the onset of DM can rescue β-cells and remit T1D completely. Our study elaborates not only the therapeutic strategy for T1D with IPEX, but also the pathogenic mechanism in general T1D."

The risks of cardiovascular and renal disease in those with multiple autoimmune diseases have not been fully described. <b><i>Materials and Methods:</i></b> Using a national database from a large health insurer in the United States (years 2001-2017) containing ∼75 million members, we calculated age- and sex-specific co-prevalence of 12 autoimmune disorders for individuals with type 1 diabetes. We then evaluated whether concomitant autoimmune diseases were associated with renal failure, ischemic stroke, and myocardial infarction. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Of the 179,248 people diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, 1 in 4 had a concomitant autoimmune disease (27.03%; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 26.83%-27.24%), with hypothyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis, and celiac disease being the most common. The prevalence of autoimmune disease was 1.9 times greater in female than male patients (<i>p</i> < 0.001). In female patients with type 1 diabetes, one in three had another autoimmune disease (35.62%; 95% CI = 35.30%-35.94%) compared with one in five male patients (19.17%; 95% CI = 18.92%-19.42%). The risk of renal failure, ischemic stroke, and myocardial infarction increased with a greater number of concomitant autoimmune diseases (<i>p</i> < 0.001, test for trend for both female and male patients).

In recent years, many cases of gut microbiota transplantation for diseases of the bowel and beyond have been reported worldwide, and this approach has been shown to be safe and effective. Here, we conducted an experimental treatment study in two adolescent patients diagnosed with autoimmune T1DM for one year. Patients received one to three rounds of normal fecal microbiota transplants (FMT) and were followed for up to 30 weeks. Clinical outcomes were measured, including biochemical indices, medication regimen, and dosage adjustment. Fecal microbiota metagenomic sequencing after transplantation provides a reference for more reasonable and effective microbiota transplantation protocols to treat autoimmune T1DM.

Therefore, we diagnosed a hyperosmolar-hyperglycemic state and he was admitted to the hospital for treatment. He had had no previous upper respiratory symptoms, and his postprandial plasma glucose and glycated hemoglobin were normal 13 days before he was first assessed (90 mg/dL and 5.9%, respectively). On admission, his serum pancreatic exocrine enzyme activities were high and he was negative for islet-specific autoantibodies. His serum C-peptide concentration was 0.60 ng/mL, suggesting that his endogenous insulin secretion was partially intact at that time. Although he did not meet the diagnostic criteria, we suspected him of having fulminant type 1 diabetes mellitus, because of the abrupt onset of hyperosmolar-hyperglycemic state.

These disorders are characterized by the presence of antibodies against tissue transglutaminase, thyroglobulin, and thyroid peroxidase (TPO), as well as against gastric parietal cells. Cross-sectional studies have reported that the risk of autoimmune thyroid diseases in patients with type-1 DM is two- to threefold higher than in the general population. However, there are a few studies in the literature that investigated the relationship between malignancy and type-1 DM, and it has been shown that type-1 DM does not increase thyroid cancer. Furthermore, there is a lot of controversy regarding the role of thyroid autoimmunity in the pathogenesis of thyroid cancer. Here, a type-1 DM patient diagnosed with papillary thyroid cancer is presented. Case Report: Herein, it was aimed to present a 20-year-old female patient diagnosed with type-1 DM and subsequently with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). Thyroid ultrasound revealed a 10×12×18 mm hypoechoic irregular edges nodule with macrocalcification and microcalcification foci in the left lobe and pathological lymph nodes without echogenic hilus were detected at the fourth level of the left cervical chain. Fine needle aspiration biopsy of the nodule was consistent with papillary thyroid carcinoma. Total thyroidectomy, bilateral central lymph node dissection, and left neck dissection (level II to IV) were performed. Pathological examination revealed a 1.4× 0.9 cm diameter papillary carcinoma located in the left lobe of the thyroid gland with 13 lymph node metastases. Conclusion: Patients with type 1 DM should be examined for thyroid diseases, and patients with suspected thyroid disease should be evaluated with a thyroid ultrasound. Type 1 DM and PTC can coexist, albeit very rare. It should be known that type 1 diabetes can be observed together with thyroid cancer."

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a novel class of endogenous RNAs with covalently closed loop structures, implicated in various disease processes. However, their impact on macrophage activation and T1DM pathogenesis remains elusive. <b>Methods:</b> circRNA expression profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from T1DM children were determined by whole transcriptome microarray. Bioinformatics, quantitative real-time PCR, Western blot, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), cell co-culture, cell proliferation, and cell apoptosis assays were performed to investigate the expression, function, and regulatory mechanisms of <i>circPPM1F in vitro</i>. The regulatory role of <i>circPPM1F in vivo</i> was evaluated in the streptozocin-induced diabetic mouse model. <b>Results:</b> We identified 27 upregulated and 31 downregulated differentially expressed circRNAs in T1DM patients. <i>circPPM1F</i>, a circRNA with unknown function, was dominantly expressed in monocytes and significantly upregulated in T1DM patients. Functionally, <i>circPPM1F</i> promoted lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced M1 macrophage activation via enhancement of the NF-κB signaling pathway. Mechanistically, <i>circPPM1F</i> competitively interacted with HuR to impair the translation of protein phosphatase, Mg<sup>2+</sup>/Mn<sup>2+</sup> dependent 1F (PPM1F), thus alleviating the inhibitory effect of PPM1F on the NF-κB pathway. Moreover, eukaryotic initiation factor 4A-III (EIF4A3) and fused in sarcoma (FUS) coordinately regulated <i>circPPM1F</i> expression during M1 macrophage activation. In addition, <i>circPPM1F</i> could exacerbate pancreas injury in the streptozocin-induced diabetic mice by activation of M1 macrophages <i>in vivo</i>. <b>Conclusions:</b> <i>circPPM1F</i> is a novel positive regulator of M1 macrophage activation through the <i>circPPM1F</i>-HuR-PPM1F-NF-κB axis. Overexpression of <i>circPPM1F</i> could promote pancreatic islet injury by enhancing M1 macrophage activation and <i>circPPM1F</i> may serve as a novel potential therapeutic target for T1DM in children."

The increased risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), including euglycemic DKA, has led many to be wary of their use in T1D, especially given limited pediatric data and data regarding cardiorenal protection in this population. The phase 3 trials of these agents in T1D have yielded lower HbA1c, decreased total daily insulin dose, and small but significant weight loss with no increase in hypoglycemia. These trials also reported increased risks of genital mycotic infection and DKA. SGLT inhibitors have been approved as adjunctive therapy to insulin in adults with T1D in Europe and Japan, but the United States Food and Drug Administration has rejected similar applications.

The aim of this study was to determine the impact of glycemic control, vascular oxidative stress and inflammation on vascular health in adolescents with T1DM. Methods This was a cross-sectional study in adolescents with age- and sex-matched T1DM who were ≥12 years and were at least 2 years post-diagnosis. Recruitment was balanced to include individuals with hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) ≤8.5% (n=27) or with HbA1c ≥9.5% (n=25). Biomarkers of inflammation were measured in the blood including C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), E-selectin, fibrinogen and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Carotid intima media thickness (cIMT) and peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT) were assessed. Results Plasma E-selectin level was significantly different between the two groups with higher levels in the group with HbA1c ≥9.5% (65.0±27.7 ng/mL vs. 48.8±21.5 ng/mL, p=0.02). Though cIMT and PAT were not significantly different between the groups, Pearson correlation showed a significant direct relationship between rising HbA1c and mean right cIMT (p=0.02; r=0.37), PAT (p=0.03, r=0.31) and fibrinogen (p=0.03, r=0.03). Conclusions Elevated E-selectin level is an early marker of oxidative stress in T1DM patients with an elevated HbA1c level. Suboptimal glycemic control as evidenced by a rising HbA1c causes early atherosclerosis."

Seventy-one patients (7-13 years) with T1D and their caregivers were administered a survey created ad hoc and some standardized questionnaires, assessing psychological well-being and anxiety. Medical data (physical and biochemical characteristics) were recorded before (T<sub>0</sub>, January-February) and after (T<sub>1</sub>, May-June) the lockdown. Paired Student <i>t</i>-test, Spearman two-tailed correlations, and a linear regression model were used for statistical analysis. Children at T<sub>1</sub> showed higher BMI (body mass index), daily total and basal insulin dose, and time spent in therapeutic range, and they showed lower HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin), time spent above the therapeutic range, and standard deviations of the mean glucose values than at T<sub>0</sub>. A total of 32.9% scored in the clinical range for separation anxiety. The increase in separation anxiety was predicted by younger age, female gender, more recent T1D diagnosis, less time spent in therapeutic range at T<sub>1</sub>, and higher perceived fear of COVID-19 infection. In a pandemic context, separation anxiety may be stronger in younger females, with more recent T1D diagnosis and poor metabolic control, thus affecting the parent's ability to manage diabetes and to support children's autonomy."

Overall, 202 patients with T1DM were registered in our study, and 192 were eligible for analysis. Baseline characteristics and laboratory values were determined. Patients completed the Japanese versions of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Diabetes Therapy-Related QOL (DTR-QOL) questionnaires. We investigated the relationship between the global PSQI and DTR-QOL total scores by using linear regression analysis. In univariate regression analysis, DTR-QOL total scores were associated with body mass index, alcohol consumption, hypertension, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and global PSQI score (all p-value <0.05) but not with sleep duration. When the association between PSQI subscales and DTR-QOL total scores was examined, DTR-QOL total scores were significantly related to subjective sleep quality and daytime dysfunction. In a multivariate regression analysis, the global PSQI score was negatively related to DTR-QOL total scores. Patients with an HbA1c concentration ≥8.0% had significantly lower DTR-QOL total scores. We revealed a relationship between QOL and sleep quality in T1DM patients and showed that the relationship between QOL and PSQI subscales in T1DM patients may be different from that in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Assessing and managing sleep quality may be necessary for patients with diabetes to improve QOL."

Luckily, a counterregulatory response (1) system exists to help minimize and reverse hypoglycemia, although more studies are needed to better characterize its components. Recently, we showed that the hormone ghrelin is permissive for the normal CRR to insulin-induced hypoglycemia when assessed in mice without diabetes. Here, we tested the hypothesis that ghrelin also is protective against insulin-induced hypoglycemia in the streptozotocin (2) mouse model of type 1 diabetes. STZ-treated ghrelin-knockout (KO) (3) mice as well as STZ-treated wild-type (WT) littermates were subjected to a low-dose hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemic clamp procedure. The STZ-treated ghrelin-KO mice required a much higher glucose infusion rate than the STZ-treated WT mice. Also, the STZ-treated ghrelin-KO mice exhibited attenuated plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine responses to the insulin-induced hypoglycemia. Taken together, our data suggest that without ghrelin, STZ-treated mice modeling type 1 diabetes are unable to mount the usual CRR to insulin-induced hypoglycemia."

Tibial shear stiffness by pQCT-FEA was also lower in T1DM subjects than in controls at both the 4% site (by 17.1%; 337.4 ± 75.5 vs 407.1 ± 75.4 kN/mm, p < 0.01) and 66% site (by 7.9%; 1113.0 ± 158.6 vs 1208.8 ± 161.8 kN/mm, p = 0.03). These differences remained statistically significant after adjustment for confounding factors. No difference between groups was observed in DXA-determined variables (all p ≥ 0.08), although there was a trend towards lower aBMD at the lumbar spine in T1DM subjects than in controls after adjustment for confounders (p = 0.053). These novel findings elicited using pQCT and pQCT-FEA suggest a clinically significant impact of T1DM on bone strength in young adult females with T1DM. Peripheral QCT and pQCT-FEA may provide more information than DXA alone on bone fragility in this population. Further longitudinal studies with a larger sample size are warranted to understand the evolution and causes of bone fragility in young T1DM females."

Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation is a promising treatment for T1DM but is limited by several factors in the diabetic host. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that dysbiotic gut microbiota may limit MSC therapy, and modulating gut microbiota may help to improve the effects of MSC transplantation. <b>Methods:</b> NOD/Ltj mice, treated with adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs), were fed with an antibiotics cocktails (Abx) for 1 week. The blood glucose levels, insulitis, intestinal permeability and gut bacteria translocation to the pancreas were evaluated. 16s rRNA and colon tissue transcription sequencing were performed to analyze beneficial bacteria and reactive host biomolecules in the ADSCs+Abx group. Based on the sequencing results, specific bacteria were gavaged orally to diabetic mice to confirm their effect on ADSCs transplantation in T1DM was determined. <b>Results:</b> We found that the recolonized the diabetic gut microbiota abolished the therapeutic effect of ADSCs. On the contrary, depletion of the diabetic gut microbiota by antibiotics treatment in diabetic mice significantly enhanced the therapeutic effects of ADSCs as measured by reversal of hyperglycemia, insulitis, and increased insulin output. Mechanistically, treatment with antibiotics increased the abundance of <i>Bifidobacterium</i> in the gut and reduced bacterial translocation to the pancreas by promoting Mucin2 expression and thickening the mucus layer through TRPM7. The mechanism was confirmed the re-colonization of the gut by <i>B.breve</i> through oral gavage that produced similar results. <b>Conclusions:</b> These results provide the rationale for a new approach to improve MSC therapy for T1DM by altering the gut microbiota."

The complication of various autoimmune disorders is known as autoimmune polyglandular syndrome (APS). Once autoimmune thyroid disease develops, various autoimmune diseases can also occur. Such phenomena are classified as APS types 3A to 3D. In this report, we show the onset of T1DM in a patient with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Sjogren's syndrome. The most important and interesting point in this case is that, if we did not check her thyroid-associated antibodies, we could not have diagnosed her as APS. From the data of this case, we assumed that the patient suffered from APS type 3A, 3B, and 3D variants. This case pointed out very clearly the importance of testing for thyroid-associated antibodies under various autoimmune disease conditions even if the thyroid hormone levels are euthyroid. Moreover, based on the strong linkage between inflammatory bowel disease and T1DM and the compatibility with both T1DM and APS type 3, we think it is possible that Hashimoto's disease is present under complicated conditions together with UC and T1DM. It would be important to repeatedly check for thyroid-associated antibodies even in euthyroid patients, especially under various autoimmune disease conditions."

Numerous therapeutic approaches have been taken to search for substitutes of β-cells, among which stem cell transplantation is one of the most promising alternatives. Stem cells have demonstrated the potential efficacy to treat T1DM by reconstitution of immunotolerance and preservation of islet β-cell function in recent research. cGMP-grade stem cell products have been used in human clinical trials, showing that stem cell transplantation has beneficial effects on T1DM, with no obvious adverse reactions. To better achieve remission of T1DM by stem cell transplantation, in this work, we explain the progression of stem cell transplantation such as mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), and bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells (BM-HSCs) to restore the immunotolerance and preserve the islet β-cell function of T1DM in recent years. This review article provides evidence of the clinical applications of stem cell therapy in the treatment of T1DM."

The glutamate transporter solute carrier family 1, member 2 (GLT1/EAAT2) is expressed on the membrane of pancreatic β-cells and physiologically controls extracellular glutamate concentrations thus preventing glutamate-induced β-cell death. We hypothesized that GLT1 could be an immunological target in T1DM and that autoantibodies against GLT1 could be pathogenic. Immunoprecipitation and ELISA experiments showed that sera from T1DM subjects recognized GLT1 expressed in brain, pancreatic islets, and GLT1-transfected COS7-cell extracts. We validated these findings in two cohorts of T1DM patients by quantitative immunofluorescence assays. Analysis of the combined data sets indicated the presence of autoantibodies against GLT1 in 32 of the 87 (37%) T1DM subjects and in none of healthy controls (n = 64) (p < 0.0001). Exposure of pancreatic βTC3 cells and human islets to purified IgGs from anti-GLT1 positive sera supplemented with complement resulted in plasma membrane ruffling, cell lysis and death. The cytotoxic effect was prevented when sera were depleted from IgGs. Furthermore, in the absence of complement, 6 out of 16 (37%) anti-GLT1 positive sera markedly reduced GLT1 transport activity in βTC3 cells by inducing GLT1 internalization, also resulting in β-cell death. In conclusion, we provide evidence that GLT1 is a novel T1DM autoantigen and that anti-GLT1 autoantibodies cause β-cell death through complement-dependent and independent mechanisms. GLT1 seems an attractive novel therapeutic target for the prevention of β-cell death in individuals with diabetes and prediabetes."

A total of 64 patients matched by age and sex were enrolled as the control group. During the program, the intervention group lost 3 cases and the control group lost 4 cases. Finally, there were 61 effective samples in the intervention group and 60 effective samples in the control group. The patients in the control group were given face-to-face education by a T1DM educator for about 2 hours. The patients in the intervention group were intervened according to TELSA structured education program. The level of glycosylated hemoglobin, the frequency of hypoglycemia, self-management ability and quality of life were evaluated before intervention, 6 months after intervention and 12 months after intervention. <b>Results:</b> The ages of the intervention group and the control group were 30.0(22.0,43.5) and 29.5(22.3,42.5) (<i>P</i>>0.05), and the proportions of males were 47.54%(29 cases) and 45.00%(27 cases), respectively (<i>P</i>>0.05). There were interaction effects (<i>P</i><0.05) on the level of glycosylated hemoglobin, self-management ability and quality of life in the two groups. At 6 and 12 months after intervention of TELSA structured education program, the level of glycosylated hemoglobin in the intervention group decreased from the baseline level (7.87±1.45)% to (7.23±1.06)% and (7.28±0.93)%, respectively, which was significantly lower than that in the control group at 6 months (7.72±1.20)% and at 12 months(7.76±1.24)% (all <i>P</i><0.05). After TELSA structured education intervention, the scores of self-management scale for adult type 1 diabetes mellitus (SMOD-CA) in the intervention group showed an upward trend (<i>P</i><0.001), and the scores of diabetes-specific quality of life scale (A-DQOL) showed a downward trend (<i>P</i><0.001). In contrast, there was no statistically significant difference in the trend of scores in the control group (<i>P</i>=0.853 and 0.227). The comparison between groups at different time points showed that at 6 and 12 months after the intervention, the SMOD-CA scores of the patients in the intervention group were higher than those in the control group (<i>P</i><0.001), and the A-DQOL scores were lower than those in the control group (<i>P</i><0.001). <b>Conclusions:</b> The TELSA structured education program can effectively ameliorate glycemic control, with the improvement of self-management ability and quality of life in adult T1DM patients."

What had been a death sentence became a manageable, albeit chronic, disease. Insulin did not cure the disease, as it did not address the actual disease process, but instead treated its sequelae, namely elevated blood sugars. Importantly, insulin administration fails to ensure normoglycaemia. Even with the most sophisticated 'near closed-loop' methods, glucose homeostasis is not restored to normal. T1DM patients face complications, both short-term, such as hypo- and hyperglycaemia, and long-term, with increased glycosylation of proteins leading to eye, kidney, nervous system and other sequelae. These complications are associated with significant morbidity and mortality even after intensive insulin treatment. Nearly 100 years after the discovery of insulin, we continue to face the challenge of addressing the disease process itself, in order to fundamentally improve the life of these patients. There are major efforts to achieve just that: to completely arrest the autoimmune process destroying the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, or at least significantly slow the process to blunt and delay short- and long-term complications. The aim of this Communication is to propose a novel assessment tool that would serve as a quantitative outcome measure by which therapies, short of clinical cure, may be compared and their true benefit to the treatment of diabetes assessed."

However, there are few studies of the prognostic and therapeutic values of the systemic autoimmune response in this pathology after transplant of autologous mesenchymal stem cells. Here, we present a 40-year-old patient with complications of type 1 diabetes mellitus (diabetic retinopathy) after mesenchymal stem cell transplant. Based on peripheral blood results, we were able to calculate integral hematologic parameters, allowing us to indirectly assess the patient's immune system after autologous mesenchymal stem cell transplant. One month after autologous mesenchymal stem cell transplant, we observed a positive immune response, with a 40% decrease in leukocyte intoxication index and a 22% increase from the initial lymphocyte and eosinophil ratio index values, which indicated the formation of a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction. Two months after transplant, stem cell leukocyte intoxication index, in contrast, increased by 10%, indicating a possible metabolic shift. At the same time, changes were observed in the lymphocyte stimulation index value, which increased by 11%. This observation indicated negative immunologic reactivity, namely, poor function of factors of nonspecific resistance due to autointoxication of the organism. However, 3 months after transplant, the hematologic parameters of this patient returned to levels before treatment. The use of integral hematologic parameters can indirectly interpret parallels between immunologic reactivity and metabolic disorders in type 1 diabetes mellitus complications (diabetic retinopathy) after autologous mesenchymal stem cell transplant. These parameters could become a diagnostic indicator in the correction of pathogenetic therapy."

The incidence of the disease is lower than that of type 2 DM and varies in different countries and ethnic groups, and the etiological and pathogenetic factors are different from T2DM. The aim of this overview is to investigate the effect of T1DM on all-cause mortality and CVD morbidity and mortality. During the last decades, the treatment of T1DM has improved the prognosis of the patients. Still, the mortality rates are higher than those of the age- and sex-matched general population. With the prolonged survival, the macrovascular complications and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) appear as major health problems in the management of patients with T1DM. The studies on the CVD morbidity and mortality in this disease group are sparse, but they reveal that T1DM is associated with at least 30% higher mortality. In comparison to healthy people, CVDs are more common in T1DM patients and they occur earlier in life. Furthermore, they are a major cause for death and impaired quality of life in T1DM patients.

Despite advances in insulin therapy, T1DM still leads to high morbidity and mortality in patients. A key focus of T1DM research has been to identify strategies that re-establish self-tolerance and suppress ongoing autoimmunity. Here, we describe a strategy that utilizes pretargeting and glycochemistry to bioengineer β cells <i>in situ</i> to induce β-cell-specific tolerance. We hypothesized that β-cell-targeted Ac<sub>4</sub>ManNAz-encapsulated nanoparticles deliver and establish β cells with high levels of surface reactive azide groups. We further theorized that administration of a dibenzylcyclooctyne (DBCO)-functionalized programmed death-ligand 1 immunoglobulin fusion protein (PD-L1-Ig) can be readily conjugated to the surface of native β cells. Using nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice, we demonstrated that our strategy effectively and selectively conjugates PD-L1 onto β cells through bioorthogonal stain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition.

In this paper, we report the outcomes of our investigation on the intradermal application of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (PDT) with curcumin in an infection induced by MRSA ATCC 43300 strain in the ear of mice with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). A solution containing 100 μg of curcumin was photoactivated ex vivo with a LED light (450 nm) delivering a fluency of 13.5 J/cm<sup>3</sup>. This solution was administered in the ear intradermally, at the same inoculum site as the MRSA ATCC 43300 strain (PDT Group). This study also included the use of two control groups (both infected): One was treated with saline and the other was treated with non-photoactivated curcumin. The animals were euthanized 24 h after these treatments and samples of draining lymph node and treated ear were collected for examination. The PDT group showed lower bacterial load in the draining lymph node when compared to the saline and curcumin groups (p-value <0.05) 24 h after treatment. In addition to bacterial load, the PDT group presented a higher concentration of nitrates and nitrites in the draining lymph node when compared to the saline and curcumin groups (p-value <0.001). Examining the infectious site, despite apparently having similar inflammatory cell recruitment compared with the control groups, the PDT group showed a profile with less intense activity in the myeloperoxidase expression when compared to the saline group (p-value <0.001). Additionally, the detected concentration of cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-12, and IL-10 was significantly lower in the PDT group when compared to the saline group (p-value <0.01; p-value <0.05; p-value <0.05, respectively), thus presenting a less intense inflammatory response during infection resolution. Our pilot study showed for the first time the therapeutic potential of PDT using curcumin when administered intradermally in the treatment of infections caused by S. aureus in mice with T1DM."
33944639,Sexual Dimorphism in Alternative Metabolic Pathways of L-Arginine in Circulating Leukocytes in Young People with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus.,['Arginase'],"['Nina Alchujyan', 'Margarita Hovhannisyan', 'Nina Movsesyan', 'Arthur Melkonyan', 'Vanuhi Shaboyan', 'Yelena Aghajanova', 'Grigory Minasyan', 'Guevork Kevorkian']","<b>Background</b>: Sexual dimorphism in specific biochemical pathways and immune response, underlies the heterogeneity of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and affects the outcome of immunotherapy. Arginase and nitric oxide (NO) synthase (NOS) metabolize L-arginine and play opposite roles in the immune response and autoimmune processes.<b>Objective:</b> We hypothesized that the above mentioned enzymes can be involved in sex and age differences in T1DM and its treatment. Based on this, the enzymes have been studied in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) and plasma of young people with T1DM.<b>Methods:</b> Patients were recruited from Muratsan University Hospital (Yerevan, Armenia) and were divided into groups: girls and boys by age, from children to adolescents and adolescents/young adults with recent-onset T1DM (RO-T1DM) (0.1-1 years) and long-term T1DM (LT-T1DM) (1.6-9.9 years). Arginase activity was assessed by L-arginine-dependent production of L-ornithine, and the NOS activity was assessed by NO/nitrite production. Glycemic control was assessed using hemoglobin A1c test. Plasma HbA1c concentration below 7.5% (median (range) 6.7 [6.2-7.5]) was taken as good glycemic control (+) and above 7.5% (median (range) 10.5 [7.6-13]) as poor glycemic control (-). Healthy volunteers with corresponding sex and age were used as the control group.<b>Results:</b> All the patients with RO-T1DM, with poor glycemic control, had increased arginase activity in the cytoplasm (cARG) and mitochondria (mARG) in PBL. In girls with RO-T1DM, with good glycemic control, the subcellular arginase activity decreased, and normalized in LT-T1DM, regardless of age. In contrast, boys from both age groups showed high arginase activity, regardless of glycemic control and duration of T1DM along with insulin therapy. At the same time, a significant decrease in the subcellular production of bioavailable NO was observed in children/preadolescents, regardless of glycemic control and duration of diabetes. In adolescents/young adult boys with RO-T1DM, with (-), the subcellular production of NO decreased significantly, and with LT-T1DM, the decrease was attenuated, but even with (+) remained lower than in healthy people. In contrast, in the group of same age girls with RO-T1DM, NO production increased above normal in both cellular compartments, while with LT-T1DM it normalized in the cytoplasm. In adolescents/young adults with LT-T1DM, NO production in PBL mitochondria decreased by almost a half, regardless of glycemic control and gender. Changes in the metabolic pathways of L-arginine in plasma differed and were less substantial than in the PBL cellular compartments in T1DM.<b>Conclusions:</b> Glycemic status and duration of T1DM along with insulin therapy affect the activity of arginase and NOS-dependent production of bioavailable NO in the cytoplasm and mitochondria in PBL of young patients with T1DM, depending on sex and age. Arginase and NOS can directly affect the processes occurring in the pancreas and the outcome of therapy through infiltrated leukocytes. Obtained data can be useful for understanding the heterogeneity of T1DM and using it to develop available criteria for assessing the severity and treatment of autoimmune diabetes."
35090949,Preventive treatment with fish oil facilitates the antidepressant-like effect of antidepressant drugs in type-1 diabetes mellitus rats: Implication of serotonergic system.,['Depression'],"['Ana Paula Farias Waltrick', 'Alvaro Henrique Bernardo de Lima Silva', 'Milene Cristina de Carvalho', 'Bruna Aparecida Comotti de Oliveira', 'Katya Naliwaiko', 'Joice Maria da Cunha', 'Janaina Menezes Zanoveli']","Treating depression associated with type-1 diabetesmellitus(T1DM) is a major clinical challenge. Fish oil (FO), composed mostly of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), has been pointed out as quite promising for the treatment of depression given its neuroprotective property. Although DHA and EPA exert several physiological actions, DHA is known to play a critical role in postnatal brain development. This study aimed to investigate the effect of preventive treatment with FO (with more DHA in the composition) alone or associated with antidepressant drugs on depression-like behaviors and brain monoamines levels of juvenile induced-T1DM rats. Thus, prepubescent rats were submitted to a prolonged treatment with vehicle (VEH) or FO (50% of DHA and 20% EPA) starting 4 weeks before the induction of experimental T1DM (on day 28) by streptozotocin. When combined, the treatment with vehicle, fluoxetine (FLX, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) or imipramine (IMI, a tricyclic antidepressant) started at week 6 (day 42) and lasted for 2 weeks (until day 56). The behavioral tests were conducted on days 55 and 56, followed by hippocampal and prefrontal cortex dissection for neurochemical analyses. Our results showed that induced-T1DM rats pretreated with FO showed a significant increase of EPA and DHA in plasma, indicative of an increase in the systemic availability of these acids. As previously observed, induced-T1DM rats presented increased immobility and decreased swimming and climbing frequencies in the modified forced swimming test, indicative of depressive-like behavior. Only the combined treatment - FO plus antidepressants (FLX or IMI - both in the highest dose) - was able to induce a significant improvement of depressive-like behaviors. Here, it is noteworthy that swimming behavior has been associated with an increase in serotonergic neurotransmission. Interestingly, our data showed that the combined treatment (FO + antidepressants - including the ineffective dose of FLX) was able to increase the swimming of animals more significantly compared to animals not pretreated with FO. In addition, confirming these assumptions, the decreased 5-HT levels in the hippocampus from induced-T1DM rats were increased after treatment with FLX (highest dose) or IMI (both doses), being this increase more pronounced in animal pretreated with FO. Intriguingly, in these animals pretreated with FO, the ineffective dose of FLX in association with FO was able to increase the levels of 5-HT. The decreased hippocampal levels of noradrenaline were increased only after IMI treatment, not being influenced by FO pretreatment. In conclusion, ours results pointed out that the choice of the DHA/EPA ratio may be an important factor to be considered for the FO antidepressant-like effectper se,but the FO treatment in this composition associated with the antidepressant drugs - especially that ones that increase preferentially the availability of 5-HT -, may represent a better alternative of treatment to individuals with T1DM-associated depression."

We aim to evaluate the influence of T1DM on male sexual function, quality of sexual life, and sex hormone levels. A total of 57 male patients aged 18 to 50 years (mean = 33) with T1DM (duration mean = 15 years) had a medical examination and completed a set of questionnaires - International Index of Erectile Function-5 (IIEF-5), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Sexual quality of life questionnaire male (SQoL-M). The prevalence of erectile dysfunction was 28.1% (IIEF-5 ≤21). Patients without diabetic nephropathy had better erectile function (p = 0.008). Subjects with better glycemic control (HbA<sub>1c</sub> <65 mmol/mol) had also better erectile function (p = 0.041). At least 8.8% patients had retrograde ejaculation. Blood serum levels of sex hormones were determined and compared to laboratory reference values of healthy men. Total testosterone level was not significantly changed, sex hormone binding globulin was higher (p < 0.001) and its level correlated with daily insulin dose adjusted to body weight (p = 0.008). Free androgen index and calculated free testosterone were lower (p = 0.013; p < 0.001), estradiol was not significantly changed, LH was higher (p < 0.001), FSH was unchanged, and prolactin was higher (p < 0.001). Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) negatively correlated with HbA<sub>1c</sub> (p < 0.001). To conclude, we found significant changes in sexual functions and sex hormone blood concentrations that indicate impairment of sexual and reproductive functions in T1DM males."

Cigarette smoking in adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus and congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Turk J Pediatr 2019; 61: 236-243. Adolescence is a long period involving many physical and psycho-social changes experienced during transition from childhood to adulthood. In this period, behaviors such as curiosity and risk-taking are common, and cigarette smoking initiation is one of those behaviors. In this study, it was aimed to find out whether chronic diseases are an effective factor or not in the cigarette smoking initiation of adolescents. One-hundred adolescents with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) and 50 adolescents with Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) aged 12 and above under follow-up at the Pediatric Endocrinology Clinic and 100 healthy adolescents within the same age group who applied to the Adolescent Outpatient Clinic were included in the study. A survey was applied to all of these adolescents, which had been developed by researchers and contained questions about their socio-demographic features and cigarette smoking. Fourteen (5.6%) of the 250 adolescents were smokers. The rate of those who tried, but quitted cigarette smoking was found as approximately 20%. Cigarette smoking rate of those with T1DM was 1%, of those with CAH was 4%, and of the healthy adolescents was 11%. Cigarette smoking was significantly lower in those with a chronic disease (2%) than those who were healthy (11%). Adolescents` parents and friends had an effect on the cigarette smoking initiation, and adolescents smoked their first cigarette generally because of curiosity. It was seen in this study that the adolescents with a chronic disease less frequently smoked cigarettes than the healthy adolescents, the rate of cigarette smoking in parents of cigarette smoking adolescents was very high, and their parents and friends had an effect on cigarette smoking initiation of adolescents."

This study aimed to assess the level of social avoidance and distress in emerging adults with T1DM, and to explore the correlation between social avoidance and distress and self-management or glycemic control. <b>METHODS</b>: A total of 342 T1DM patients aged 18-30 years old were recruited from 8 tertiary hospitals in Hunan Province from September 2014 to February 2019. The questionnaire included general information questionnaire, the Social Avoidance and Distress Scale (SAD), and Self-management Scale of Type 1 Diabetes for Chinese Adults (SMOD-CA). The total scores of SAD in emerging adult patients with T1DM were compared with those of norm. Correlation between glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and social avoidance and distress of emerging adult patients with T1DM was analyzed. <b>RESULTS</b>: The total score of SAD (11.13±6.18) in emerging adults with T1DM was significantly higher than that in healthy adults (<i>t</i>=77.06, <i>P</i><0.01). Pearson correlation analysis showed that the scores of SAD, social avoidance subscale, and social distress subscale were negatively correlated with the scores of SMOD-CA (all <i>P</i><0.01), and they were positively correlated with HbA1c (all <i>P</i><0.01). Multivariate linear regression analysis showed that social avoidance and distress, self-management, gender, and educational level were independent influential factors for HbA1c in emerging adults with T1DM. <b>CONCLUSION</b>: The degree of social avoidance and distress of emerging adult patients with T1DM is higher than that of healthy people. The higher the degree of social avoidance and distress, the lower the level of self-management and the worse the control of blood sugar. Attention should be paid to social avoidance and distress in emerging adults with T1DM, and targeted interventions should be formulated."

However, a diabetic patient's increased focus on diet and weight control,although necessary, can lead to disturbed eating habits, medical complications, and ""resistance"" to treatment. The term ""diabulimia"" refers to the eating disorder in which patients with T1DM take less insulinin order to control their weight. Currently there is no valid questionnaire in the Greek language for the detection of eating disorders in T1DM. This study examines the psychometric properties of the Greek version of the Diabetes Eating Problem Survey-Revised (DEPS-R), a questionnaire that assesses the risk of ""diabulimia""in patients with T1DM. 100 outpatients with a T1DM diagnosis of over one year -71 women and 35users of a continuous insulin infusion pump- were asked to complete the DEPS-R questionnaire translated into Greek (0-80 score range, >20 indicating high risk of disorders) along with the EAT-26 (0-78 score range,>20 indicating high risk of pathological eating behaviours or eating disorder) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-ΙΙ) (0-63 score range, >14 indicating high risk of major depressive disorder). The Greek versionof the DEPS-R showed strong internal consistency and construct validity (Cronbach's alpha=0,89 in total,0,90 in females and 0,85 in males). Factorial analysis revealed 4 factors (diet, weight loss, insulin use and compensatory behaviors) accounting for 65.68% of the total variance (19.90%, 18.50%, 15.64% and 11.65%of the total variance respectively). In addition, 35% of the sample scored above 20 on the EAT-26, 26% rated above 14 on the BDI-II and 40% had a score above 20 on the DEPS-R, while the average score was 19.22. The sound psychometric properties of the DEPS-R scale were confirmed for a Greek sample with T1DM suggesting that it could be used as a reliable tool for the detection of diabulimia. In addition, we found that Greek patients with T1DM appear to have an increased risk of developing eating disorders and depression."

The sample presented good glycemic control and 30.1% scored above the established DEPS-R cut-off score for disturbed eating behavior. CFA results revealed that the data fit well to the factor models. The DEPS-R scale had good reliability and was positively linked to BMI, HbA1c, total daily dose and time in range. Model comparison supported the superiority of the 1-factor model, implying that Greek clinicians and practitioners might not have to consider individualized treatment based on various scores across different subscales but they can adopt a single DEPS-R score for an easy and efficient screening for disordered eating."

Our results showed that severe type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) caused a higher expression of Hsp90α, but not Hsp70. Moreover, injections of the peroxiredoxin 6 antioxidant enzyme (PRDX6) did not affect the expression of these chaperones. Conversely, pro-inflammatory cytokines added to β-cells caused a significant increase in the expression of Hsp90α and, substantially, Hsp70. Moreover, cells cultivated in the presence of PRDX6 were more susceptible to the cytokine effect. Thus, in the course of severe alloxan-induced T1D, no protective role of the heat shock proteins, was revealed, and their expression level was not increased by PRDX6.

Enhanced platelet reactivity is considered a main determinant of the increased atherothrombotic risk of diabetic patients. Thrombopoietin (THPO), a humoral growth factor able to stimulate megakaryocyte proliferation and differentiation, also modulates the response of mature platelets by enhancing both activation and binding to leukocytes in response to different agonists. Increased THPO levels have been reported in different clinical conditions characterized by a generalized pro-thrombotic state, from acute coronary syndromes to sepsis/septic shock, and associated with elevated indices of platelet activation. To investigate the potential contribution of elevated THPO levels in platelet activation in T1DM patients, we studied 28 T1DM patients and 28 healthy subjects. We measured plasma levels of THPO, as well as platelet-leukocyte binding, P-selectin, and THPO receptor (THPOR) platelet expression. The priming activity of plasma from diabetic patients or healthy subjects on platelet-leukocyte binding and the role of THPO on this effect was also studied in vitro. T1DM patients had higher circulating THPO levels and increased platelet-monocyte and platelet-granulocyte binding, as well as platelet P-selectin expression, compared to healthy subjects, whereas platelet expression of THPOR did not differ between the two groups. THPO concentrations correlated with platelet-leukocyte binding, as well as with fasting glucose and Hb1Ac. In vitro, plasma from diabetic patients, but not from healthy subjects, primed platelet-leukocyte binding and platelet P-selectin expression. Blocking THPO biological activity using a specific inhibitor prevented the priming effect induced by plasma from diabetic patients. In conclusion, augmented THPO may enhance platelet activation in patients with T1DM, potentially participating in increasing atherosclerotic risk."

An alternative way to test classical HLA alleles is by using tag SNP. A set of tag SNP for several classical HLA alleles has been reported as associated with susceptibility or resistance to this disease in Europeans.
Objective: We aimed at validating the methodology based on tag SNP focused on the inference of classical HLA alleles, and at evaluating their association with type 1 diabetes mellitus in a sample of 200 families from Antioquia.
Materials and methods: We studied a sample of 200 families from Antioquia. Each family had one or two children with T1D. We genotyped 13 SNPs using tetra-primer ARMS-PCR or PCRRFLP. In addition, we tested the validity of the tag SNP reported for Europeans in 60 individuals from a population of Colombians living in Medellín (CLM) from the 1000 Genomes Project database. Statistical analyses included the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the transmission disequilibrium and the linkage disequilibrium tests.
Results: The linkage disequilibrium was low in reported tag SNP and classical HLA alleles in this CLM population. Association analyses revealed both risk and protection factors to develop type 1 diabetes mellitus. Appropriate tag SNPs for the CLM population were determined by using the genotype information available in the 1000 Genome Project database.
Conclusions: Although linkage disequilibrium patterns in this CLM population were different from those reported in Europeans, we did find strong evidence of the role of HLA in the development of type 1 diabetes mellitus in the study population."

Patients with T1DM and age- and sex-matched controls were included. Subjects with HHV infection were subgrouped into those with histories of varicella-zoster virus, herpes simplex virus (HSV), Epstein-Barr virus, and human cytomegalovirus infections. The odds ratio of the risk of T1DM was calculated using a multivariable conditional logistic regression model. Atopic diseases, autoimmune thyroid diseases, and history of enterovirus infection served as adjusted comorbidities. Our findings suggested a significant association between HSV infection and the risk of T1DM (adjusted odds ratio: 1.21; 95% CI: 1.01-1.47, <i>p</i> = 0.048), while infection with other HHVs was not.

Both glycemic control and adherence may be negatively impacted by poor psychological outcomes in adolescence, such as depressive symptoms and low hopefulness. The purpose of this study was to examine associations between the mealtime insulin bolus score (BOLUS), a more robust proxy measure of adherence than frequency of blood glucose monitoring or self-report, with depressive symptoms, hope, and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). Ninety adolescents completed measures of hope (Children's Hope Scale) and depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale), as well as lab-based measures of HbA1c and mealtime insulin bolus scores (BOLUS). Higher levels of hope were associated with lower levels of depressive symptoms, more frequent mealtime insulin boluses, and better glycemic control. Higher levels of BOLUS behavior were associated with lower depressive symptoms and better glycemic control. Both BOLUS behavior and hope independently and significantly impacted the relationship between depressive symptoms and HbA1c, suggesting a possible mediation. Since hope and BOLUS were each associated with the relationship between depressive symptoms and glycemic control, following confirmation of this relationship in a longitudinal study, clinics may consider measuring hope and BOLUS among youth with high depressive symptoms and further investigating BOLUS behavior and hope as potential intervention targets to improve glycemic control."

FOXO3, cooperatively with FOXO1, control the development and function of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells (T<sub>reg</sub>). Since the lack of T<sub>reg</sub>-mediated control has fundamental impact on type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) development, we investigated <i>FOXO3</i> expression in patients with T1DM. <i>FOXO3</i> expression was estimated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from newly diagnosed T1DM pediatric patients (<i>n</i> = 28) and age-matched healthy donors (<i>n</i> = 27) by reahavel-time PCR and TaqMan gene expression assays. Expression analysis revealed significant upregulation of <i>FOXO3</i> in T1DM (<i>P</i> = 0.0005). Stratification of the T1DM group according to the presence of initial diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) did not indicate differences in <i>FOXO3</i> expression in patients with DKA compared to a mild T1DM onset (<i>P</i> > 0.05). In conclusion, overexpression of <i>FOXO3</i> is correlated with the ongoing islet autoimmune destruction and might suggest a potential role for this gene in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes mellitus."
31287801,A novel individualized drug repositioning approach for predicting personalized candidate drugs for type 1 diabetes mellitus.,['drug repositioning'],['Hong Zheng'],"The existence of high cost-consuming and high rate of drug failures suggests the promotion of drug repositioning in drug discovery. Existing drug repositioning techniques mainly focus on discovering candidate drugs for a kind of disease, and are not suitable for predicting candidate drugs for an individual sample. Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is a disorder of glucose homeostasis caused by autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic β-cell. Here, we present a novel single sample drug repositioning approach for predicting personalized candidate drugs for T1DM. Our method is based on the observation of drug-disease associations by measuring the similarities of individualized pathway aberrance induced by disease and various drugs using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov weighted Enrichment Score algorithm. Using this method, we predicted several underlying candidate drugs for T1DM. Some of them have been reported for the treatment of diabetes mellitus, and some with a current indication to treat other diseases might be repurposed to treat T1DM. This study conducts drug discovery via detecting the functional connections among disease and drug action, on a personalized or customized basis. Our framework provides a rational way for systematic personalized drug discovery of complex diseases and contributes to the future application of custom therapeutic decisions."

The most critical outcome of hypopituitarism is caused by secondary adrenal insufficiency. Glucocorticoid deficiency is a life-threatening condition, and patients who develop this deficiency require prompt diagnosis and treatment. However, a delayed diagnosis of hypopituitarism may occur due to its non-specific clinical manifestations. A common presenting sign of glucocorticoid deficiency is hypoglycemia. The amelioration of hyperglycemia has been observed in diabetic patients with adrenal insufficiency. We report the case of a 70-year-old Japanese woman who had suffered from fatigue and anorexia for several months; she was admitted based on refractory hyponatremia (sodium 125-128 mEq/L) and hypoglycemia (glucose 58-75 mg/dL). Laboratory findings and magnetic resonance imaging findings led to the diagnosis of panhypopituitarism caused by autoimmune hypophysitis. After receiving 10 mg/day of hydrocortisone, the patient developed severe hyperglycemia (glucose >500 mg/dL). Undetectable C-peptide levels and positive results of both insulinoma-associated antigen-2 antibodies and insulin autoantibodies indicated that she had experienced a recent onset of type 1 diabetes. The pathophysiological process indicated that overt hyperglycemia could be masked by the deficient action of glucocorticoids even in a diabetic patient with endogenous insulin deficiency. This uncommon case reinforces the importance of the prompt diagnosis and treatment of hypopituitarism. Clinicians should remain aware of the possibility of hidden diabetes when treating hypoglycemia in patients with adrenal insufficiency."

The expression of <i>parp-1</i> and <i>bax</i> genes was estimated on mRNA levels using real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. <b>Results.</b> After 8 weeks, diabetic rats had weight loss, while blood glucose was increased about 4.9-fold compared to control group. Vitamin D<sub>3</sub> administration to diabetic animals had no effect on these parameters. It was found that total serum alkaline phosphatase activity was significantly elevated in diabetic rats as compared to control animals and was restored by vitamin D<sub>3</sub>. Diabetes was accompanied by reduction of nicotinamidadenindinucleotide, a substrate of poly-ADP-ribosylation, level by 31.7% as compared to control rats, which was not reversed in response to vitamin D<sub>3</sub> treatment. In diabetic hearts, the mRNA expression level of <i>parp-1</i> gene was 2.8-fold higher compared to control rats and partially decreased by vitamin D3 treatment. Less significant alterations were observed in diabetic hearts for the mRNA expression level of <i>bax</i> gene that was 2.0-fold higher compared to control animals and vitamin D<sub>3</sub> normalized it. These results indicate that cardiomyocytes have a tendency to apoptosis. <b>Conclusions.</b> The findings suggest that investigated genes can be targets at the transcriptional level for vitamin D action that may be contributed to the improving metabolic/signaling pathways induced by diabetes mellitus."

However, there is insufficient evidence in middle childhood on psychological mechanisms involved that might complicate the adaptation of these children. Therefore, 106 children (<i>N</i> = 31 with T1D and <i>N</i> = 75 as matched healthy group [HG]) aged 8 to 13 were assessed using the <i>Child Attachment Interview</i>, the <i>Child Behavior Checklist</i>, and the measure of glycated hemoglobin. Results showed that insecure T1D children did not have worse diabetes control than the secure ones. However, T1D children differed from HG for higher levels of idealization to father and withdrawn/depressed problems. Moreover, T1D children with insecure attachment to mother scored significantly higher in anxious/depressed, withdrawn/depressed, attention problems, and rule-breaking behavior, while T1D children with insecure attachment to father scored significantly higher only in the withdrawn/depressed scale compared to the remaining children. Therefore, diabetes does not in itself determine a psychological vulnerability in middle childhood, but the presence of an insecure attachment, especially to the mother, worsens the psychological adaptation of T1D children. Psychological support should be provided for these young patients and their families."

All T1D admissions to the 4 week Chronic Illness Management Program (CIMP) between 1 January 2016 and 31 December 2017 were eligible for inclusion. Data related to physiological and psychosocial outcomes were compared between admission and discharge. Follow-up data, including hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), psychosocial measures, and health care utilization, were collected at 3, 6, and 12 months after discharge to assess sustained changes. Fifty-seven T1D admissions were included in the sample. There was a significant reduction in mean HbA1c from admission (11.1%/98 mmol/mol) to discharge (9.1%/76 mmol/mol). Patients also demonstrated significant improvements in all psychosocial outcome measures. Improvements in HbA1c were sustained at 3 months follow-up; however, average values returned to baseline by 6 months follow-up. In contrast to preadmission history, the majority of the sample reported reduced crisis health care utilization 1 year after discharge. The inpatient setting provides an intensive treatment model for diabetes management that promotes sustainable behavior change 3 months after discharge. While additional community supports are needed for long-term improvement, this program model may benefit patients who have been unable to manage their diabetes with outpatient treatment and therapy alone."

Patients with diabetes are at a high risk of adverse outcomes after COVID-19 infection, whereas infection itself can be associated with severe hyperglycemia, including hyperglycemic emergencies. While the accelerated vaccine development and rollout have considerably decreased morbidity and mortality with reasonable safety, there are emerging reports of worsening of hyperglycemia in response to vaccination, with possible shared pathophysiology with COVID-19 infection-related hyperglycemia. We hereby report two young patients with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) who presented with severe diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) after receiving second doses of COVISHIELD (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) and COVAXIN (BBV152- inactivated whole virion) vaccines. Though a causal link cannot be established, post-vaccination immune response can potentially explain this transient worsening of hyperglycemia and hyperglycemic emergencies. We, hence report diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) following COVID-19 vaccination in T1DM. We suggest that people with diabetes, particularly patients with T1DM with inadequate glycemic control should ideally be closely monitored for hyperglycemia and ketonemia for at least 2 weeks after receiving vaccination for COVID 19."

Emerging evidence suggests that pancreatic islet microcirculation is impaired in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Here, we investigated the potential ultrastructural protective effects of insulin against streptozotocin (STZ)-induced ultrastructural abnormalities of the pancreatic islet microcirculation in T1DM mouse model. For this purpose, pancreatic tissues were collected from control, STZ-induced T1DM and insulin-treated mice, and a pancreatic IMECs cell line (MS1) was cultured under control, 35 mM glucose with or without 10-8 M insulin conditions. Transmission and scanning electron microscopies were employed to evaluate the ultrastructure of the pancreatic islet microcirculation. We observed ultrastructural damage to IMECs and IMPCs in the type 1 diabetic group, as demonstrated by destruction of the cytoplasmic membrane and organelles (mainly mitochondria), and this damage was substantially reversed by insulin treatment. Furthermore, insulin inhibited collagenous fiber proliferation and alleviated edema of the widened pancreatic islet exocrine interface in T1DM mice.

The selected markers of endothelial lesions (sVCAM-1, sICAM-1, sE-SELECTIN, PAI-1, ADMA and RAGE) were assayed by the immunoenzymatic ELISA method. The study involved 66 patients (age: 5-18 years) with type 1 diabetes and 21 healthy controls (age: 5-16 years). In the type 1 diabetes patients, significantly higher concentrations of all of the assayed markers were observed compared to the healthy controls (<i>p</i> < 0.001). All of the evaluated markers positively correlated with the disease duration, the age, and BMI of the patients, while only PAI-1 and sE-SELECTIN were characteristic of linear correlations with the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). It can be concluded that endothelial inflammatory disease occurs in the early stages of type 1 diabetes mellitus in children. The correlations between PAI-1, sE-SELECTIN, and eGFR suggest an advantage of these markers over other markers of endothelial dysfunction as prognostic factors for kidney dysfunction in children with type 1 diabetes."

Thus, β-cell protection may be a primary target in the treatment of T1DM. Evidence has demonstrated that defective mitochondrial function plays an important role in pancreatic β-cell dysfunction and apoptosis; however, the fundamental effect of mitochondrial complex I action on β-cells and T1DM remains unclear. In the current study, the pancreas protective effect of complex I inhibitor rotenone (ROT) and its potential mechanism were assessed in a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced mouse model of T1DM and in cultured mouse pancreatic β-cell line, Min6. ROT treatment exerted a hypoglycemic effect, restored the insulin level, and decreased inflammation and cell apoptosis in the pancreas. In vitro experiments also showed that ROT decreased STZ- and inflammatory cytokines-induced β-cell apoptosis. These protective effects were accompanied by attenuation of reactive oxygen species, increased mitochondrial membrane potential, and upregulation of transcriptional coactivator PPARα coactivator 1α (PGC-1α)-controlled mitochondrial biogenesis. These findings suggest that mitochondrial complex I inhibition may represent a promising strategy for β-cell protection in T1DM."

Majority of T1DM patients who carried homozygous variant (TT) genotype of the PTPN22 gene had either DR3-DRB5 or DRB3-DRB4 genotypes. In T1DM patients who co-inherited the high risk HLA DQ, DR alleles with the variant genotype of PTPN22 gene, the majority were positive for three autoantibodies. Our data demonstrate that the variant T-allele of the PTPN22 gene along with HLA-DQ2 and DQ8 alleles constitute significant determinants of genetic predisposition of T1DM in Kuwaiti children."

This increase in CP indicates the possibility of pancreatic beta cell regeneration and/or increased function. The commonly accepted belief that individuals with T1DM quickly lose all function of pancreatic beta cells has led to academic consequences; many immunotherapy clinical trials' inclusion criteria require participants to have a new diagnosis of T1DM based on the assumption that those with a longer duration of diabetes have unrecoverable cessation of insulin secretion. CP could influence inflammation, microvascular circulation, and endothelial function. Further, it could affect the neuronal and glomerular structure and/or function. These potential functions of CP are seen by the correlation between measurable CP levels and decreased diabetic complication rates."

Objectives We aim to determine the prevalence of associated autoimmune diseases (Hashimoto's thyroiditis, celiac disease (CD), and adrenal insufficiency (AI)) and evaluate the most reporting symptoms and glycemic control assessment, as well as microvascular complications and hypoglycemia episodes. Methods A cross-sectional study of 251 patients with T1DM at the diabetic clinic of King Abdulaziz Medical City in Riyadh (KAMC-RD), Saudi Arabia, was conducted. Autoimmune serologies including thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibody and tissue transglutaminase IgA (tTG-IgA) antibody were checked with hormonal studies such as thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), morning serum cortisol, and short Synacthen test (SST) with duodenal biopsy results all were reviewed if present. Patients were directly interviewed to evaluate for the most common symptoms (including hypoglycemia episodes) for the preceding two weeks. Glycemic control was assessed by measuring glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). Microvascular complications (i.e., nephropathy and retinopathy) were estimated by looking at the urine albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) besides the ophthalmology's visit notes. Results The mean age was 26.3 ± 7.7 years, and the mean duration of diabetes at the time of data collection was 12.2 ± 7.6 years, whereas the mean HbA1c was 8.9% ± 1.8%. The prevalence of hypothyroidism was 16.3%, and TPO positivity was discovered in 58.6% of the tested patients (n = 70) with equal prevalence among both genders (p = 0.685). tTG-IgA were noticed among 16.4% of the patients (n = 164) without significant difference among gender. Serum cortisol test was performed among 128 patients; 28.1% had suboptimal levels, and 5.5% were deficient. Only four patients (n = 15) had suboptimal responses after SST. Nervousness and anxiety (p < 0.001), fatigue with weakness (p = 0.018), weight gain (p = 0.017), and cold intolerance (p = 0.005) were noted, which were statistically significantly higher among females. Weight gain was statistically significantly higher among the age group of >30 years (p = 0.036). For microvascular complication screening, ACR was collected in 199 (79.2%) participants, with a mean of 27.7 ± 155.9 mg/mmol. Only 10 (5%) patients had microalbuminuria, and 16 (8%) had macroalbuminuria; it was correlated significantly with diabetes duration (p = 0.045). A total of 132 (52.8%) patients were seen by ophthalmology, 28 (21.4%) had nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR), and 10 (7.6%) has proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) that significantly correlated with the duration of diabetes (p = 0.027). During patient interviews, 187 (74.5%) reported symptomatic hypoglycemia events that correlated significantly with glycemic control (p = 0.029). Conclusion Autoimmunity in Saudi adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus was significant with equal prevalence among both genders and age groups with no or slight difference. Clinical manifestations of autoimmunity were higher in women. Diabetes chronicity and poor glycemic control were the major complications; therefore, early glycemic control is advocated. Regular screening for autoimmunity and its complications is recommended for type 1 diabetic patients. Autoimmunity was found almost similar to previous literature."

It is associated with macrovascular and microvascular complications. Tight glycaemic control has been shown to ameliorate the long-term complications of T1DM, but this benefit has to be balanced with the risk and fear of hypoglycaemia. Monitoring glucose levels frequently helps patients to achieve more intensive glycaemic control. Finger prick blood glucose monitoring has traditionally been the most commonly used method to monitor glucose levels. More recently, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems, which measure interstitial glucose, have become available. CGM systems remove or significantly reduce the need for blood glucose testing and have been shown in real world and clinical trial settings to improve glycaemic control, reduce frequency of hypoglycaemia, improve recognition of hypoglycaemia and improve quality of life. The question now is whether CGM should replace capillary blood glucose measurements and be offered to all patients with T1DM."

Focus of the review is on the role of innate immune system, including activation of some signaling cascades, cytokine response, and activity of the Toll-like receptors in the development of T1D. Dysfunction of innate immunity is the cause of the attack of pancreatic beta cells by the host T-lymphocytes, which leads to the death of pancreatic beta cells that produce insulin. Lack of insulin causes hyperglycemia and the need for lifelong injections of insulin in patients with T1D, which, nevertheless, does not exclude damage to many organs and tissues, given particular vulnerability of the blood vessels under conditions of hyperglycemia. The review discusses the role of oxidative stress as a factor that plays a major role in damage of vascular system and pancreatic tissue during the development of T1D. Considering high sensitivity of pancreatic beta cells to the action of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the possibility of using antioxidants for reducing the level of pathological consequences in the course of T1D development is discussed. New information on anti-diabetic activity of the exogenous antioxidant enzyme peroxiredoxin 6, which is capable of penetrating cells, activating insulin production in beta cells, reducing ROS levels, as well as decreasing activation of some signaling cascades, production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and expression of Toll-like receptors in beta cells and in immune cells during T1D development is discussed."
31192721,"A Preliminary Study on ""PRISMA"" Education in Improving Self-Management and Level of Compliance in Children with Type-1 Diabetes Mellitus.",['PRISMA education'],"['Priska Emiliana', 'Nur Agustini', 'Yeni Rustina']","Children with Type-1 Diabetes Mellitus (TIDM) need long-term care that requires supervision. Without good management, there will be an increase in blood glucose, which can cause complications in organs and tissues. One way to improve self-management and level of compliance in blood glucose control is by providing education. This study aimed to determine the effect of PRISMA education on self-management and level of compliance in children with T1DM. This study used a quasi-experimental design with no control group. PRISMA education using animated videos was given to the respondents who filled out the questionnaire about self-management and level of compliance (pre-test) and were evaluated on the eighth day (post-test). The sample of this study consisted of 31 children in Jakarta, Bogor, Depok, and Tangerang. The results of this study indicate that PRISMA education had significant effects on self-management (<i>p</i> < 0.05) and level of compliance (<i>p</i> < 0.05). The delivery of self-management education in the form of animated videos could improve self-management and children's compliance in the management of diet, physical act, treatment, stress management and blood glucose control. Thus, this educational tool could be useful if it is integrated into nursing interventions, especially in the field of pediatric nursing."

The rapid development of bioinformatics and large-scale sequencing has led to the identification of functional circRNAs. Despite an overall upward trend, studies focusing on the roles of circRNAs in immune diseases remain relatively scarce. In the present study, we obtained a differential circRNA expression profile based on microarray analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in children with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). We characterized one differentially expressed circRNA back-spliced from the MYB Proto-Oncogene Like 2 (<i>MYBL2</i>) gene in patients with T1DM, termed as <i>hsa_circ_0060450</i>. Subsequent assays revealed that <i>hsa_circ_0060450</i> can serve as the sponge of miR-199a-5p, release its target gene, Src homology 2 (SH2)-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP2), encoded by the tyrosine-protein phosphatase non-receptor type 11 gene (<i>PTPN11</i>), and further suppress the JAK-STAT signaling pathway triggered by type I interferon (IFN-I) to inhibit macrophage-mediated inflammation, which indicates the important roles of circRNAs in T1DM and represents a promising therapeutic molecule in the treatment of T1DM."

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of stem cells transplantation (SCT) in patients with T1DM. We searched five literature databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, WanFang and CENTRAL) up to 31 October 2019. 29 studies (487 patients with T1DM) were included in our meta-analysis. There was no substantial publication bias. Meta-analysis showed the SCT had significant effect to decrease HbA1c (SMD, 1.40; 95% CI, 0.93 to 1.86; p < 0.00001; I<sup>2</sup> = 89%) and to improve C-peptide levels (SMD, -0.62; 95% CI, -1.22 to -0.02; p = 0.04; I<sup>2</sup> = 92%) at 1 year follow-up. Subgroup analyses showed the heterogeneity level of the results was high. Significant improvement of metabolic outcomes was observed in the subgroups of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) combined with hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and HSCs. The older age showed significant association with the efficacy in HSCs subgroup. The higher GADA positive rate before treatment also significantly associated with the decrease of daily insulin requirement. The transient insulin independence rate at last follow-up was 9.6 per 100 person-years (95% CI: 5.8-13.5%). The mean length of insulin independence was 15.6 months (95% CI: 12.3-18.9). The mortality of SCT was 3.4% (95% CI: 2.1-5.5%). Therefore, SCT is an efficacious and safe method for treating patients with T1DM especially in the subgroups of MSCs + HSCs and HSCs. Well designed, double blind and randomized controlled trails with large sample size and long-term follow-up are needed for further evaluation."

A few studies have suggested that minocycline that inhibits microglia may attenuate pain hypersensitivity in PDN. Moreover, a recent study reported that minocycline has an acute antidepressive-like effect in diabetic animals. Here we studied whether (i) prolonged minocycline treatment suppresses pain behaviour in PDN, (ii) the minocycline effect varies with submodality of pain, and (iii) the suppression of pain behaviour by prolonged minocycline treatment is associated with antidepressive-like effect. The experiments were performed in streptozotocin-induced rat model of type-1 diabetes. Pain behaviour was evoked by innocuous (monofilaments) and noxious (paw pressure) mechanical stimulation, innocuous cold (acetone drops) and noxious heat (radiant heat). Depression-like behaviour was assessed using forced swimming test. Minocycline treatment (daily 80mg/kg per os) of three-week duration started four weeks after induction of diabetes. Diabetes induced mechanical allodynia and hyperalgesia, cold allodynia, heat hypoalgesia, and depression-like behaviour. Minocycline treatment significantly attenuated mechanical allodynia and depression-like behaviour, while it failed to produce significant changes in mechanical hyperalgesia, cold allodynia or heat hypoalgesia. The results indicate that prolonged per oral treatment with minocycline has a sustained mechanical antiallodynic and antidepressive-like effect in PDN. These results support the proposal that minocycline might provide a treatment option for attenuating sensory and comorbid emotional symptoms in chronic PDN."

A random effects model was used to generate the summary risk estimates. The PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched to identify relevant observational studies. Twenty one observational studies were included in the present meta-analysis. Compared with offspring of mothers with normal weight, offspring of women with overweight or obesity were at an increased risk of developing childhood-onset T1DM (overweight: relative risk [RR] 1.09, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-1.15; obesity: RR 1.25, 95% CI, 1.16-1.34; per 5 kg m<sup>-2</sup> increase in BMI: RR 1.10, 95% CI, 1.06-1.13).

Pancreas and islet transplantation have emerged as promising treatments for reconstructing the normal regulation of blood glucose in T1DM patients. However, a critical shortage of pancreases and islets derived from human organ donors, complications associated with transplantations, high cost, and limited procedural availability remain bottlenecks in the widespread application of these strategies. Attempts have been directed to accommodate the increasing population of patients with T1DM. Stem cell therapy holds great potential for curing patients with T1DM. With the advent of research on stem cell therapy for various diseases, breakthroughs in stem cell-based therapy for T1DM have been reported.

Many studies have investigated polymorphisms in the <i>VDR</i> gene in association with T1DM in different populations, but there are still conflicting findings. This study aimed to evaluate the association of four variants in the <i>VDR</i> gene (rs7975232, rs1544410, rs731236, and rs2228570) with T1DM risk and vitamin D levels within a population from North Region, Brazil, as well as the influence of genomic ancestry on T1DM. A total of 65 T1DM patients and 83 non-T1DM patients were enrolled in this study. <i>VDR</i> gene polymorphisms were assessed using Sanger sequencing analysis. Genomic ancestry was analyzed using a set of 61 ancestry-informative markers. T1DM patients showed higher European genomic contribution and lower Native American genomic contribution when compared to non-T1DM patients. T1DM patients with AA genotype in rs1544410 or CC genotype in rs731236 had significantly lower 25(OH)D levels compared to the other two genotypes (<i>p</i> = 0.013 and <i>p</i> = 0.02, respectively), while T1DM with TT genotype in rs2228570 had higher 25(OH)D levels compared to CC + TC in the same polymorphism (<i>p</i> = 0.011). Our findings suggest that the association between 25(OH)D and T1DM may be modified by <i>VDR</i> variants, possibly influencing the development of this autoimmune disease."

N-Acetyl-Cysteine (NAC) is regarded as facilitating endothelial cell function and angiogenesis and may have treatment effect in the case of diabetes. However, the impact of NAC on T1DM are unknown. Here we reported that inflammatory pathogenesis of canine type 1 diabetes liver disease and the therapeutic effect of NAC combined with insulin. For this purpose, the model was established by intravenous injection of streptozotocin (20 mg/kg). Forty adult dogs were used and divided into 5 groups: control group, DM group, insulin treatment group, NAC combined with insulin therapy, and NAC group, while study lasted for 16 weeks. Results showed that the level of liver function enzyme activity were apparently increased in DM group, while the NAC with insulin treatment remarkable decreased liver function enzyme levels. Histopathology revealed that obvious changes in liver structure of all DM group, as evidenced by hepatocyte disorder and cellular swelling. Liver structure was evaluated by Periodic Acid Schiff (PAS) and Masson staining, the tissues appeared glycogen deposition and collagen deposition, indicating that DM aggravated liver injury. Compared with control group, the protein and mRNA expression of NLRP3, Caspase-1, ASC, and GSDMD were significantly induced in the DM group, while INS and NAC combined with INS treatment reversed the above changes. The levels of NF-κB P65, p-NF-κB, and IFN γ were availably enhanced in the DM group, which decreased through insulin and NAC combined with insulin treatment. This study demonstrated that NAC combined with INS exerted protective effects against STZ-induced liver injury by inhibiting the NLRP3/NF-κB pathway. The findings indicated that NAC combined with INS may serve as a potential candidate therapy for the treatment of T1DM."

To test a new visual analytics (VA) method with reduced complexity of OCT data analysis by comparing the layer thickness of children with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) to matched controls. <b>Methods</b>: OCT was performed on unilateral eyes of 26 children with T1DM without diabetic retinopathy and 29 healthy children to obtain macular volume scans. Subsequently, segmented inner retinal layers were analyzed using VA. Deviation maps were generated to readily visualize thickness differences between both groups and to investigate thickness changes of individual patients in relation to the control group. <b>Results</b>: In DevMs of the patient group, the total retina (TR) demonstrated localized, irregular areas of thinning (mean ± standard deviation) involving foveal center, inner macula, and inferior-nasal outer macula (-9.31 ± 1.73 µm; p < 0.05). Similarly, retinal nerve fiber layer showed continuous and localized areas of thinning in both inner and outer macula, extending nasally (-5.45 ± 4.31 µm; p < 0.05). In DevMs of individual patients, the TR and inner retinal layers revealed remarkable changes in thickness that were present between patients at both late and early stages of diabetes. <b>Conclusion</b>: The VA method simplifies the in-depth analysis of OCT volume data from different groups and is effective in detecting retinal thickness changes in children with diabetes. It can be easily adopted in a clinical set-up and intuitively used in complex multidisciplinary studies."

The present multicenter study was conducted in different hospitals in UAE including University Hospital Sharjah, Dubai Hospital and Rashid Hospital. A total of fifty-eight Emirati participants aged above 18 years and with a BMI < 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> were recruited and forty-five of these participants had a confirmed diagnosis of T1DM. Five groups of complications associated with the latter were identified including hyperlipidemia, neuropathy, ketoacidosis, hypothyroidism and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). A comprehensive whole transcriptomic analysis using NGS was conducted. The outcomes of the study revealed the common DEGs between T1DM without complications and T1DM with different complications. The results revealed seven common candidate DEGs, SPINK9, TRDN, PVRL4, MYO3A, PDLIM1, KIAA1614 and GRP were upregulated in T1DM complications with significant increase in expression of SPINK9 (Fold change: 5.28, 3.79, 5.20, 3.79, 5.20) and MYO3A (Fold change: 4.14, 6.11, 2.60, 4.33, 4.49) in hyperlipidemia, neuropathy, ketoacidosis, hypothyroidism and PCOS, respectively.

Fulminant type 1 diabetes mellitus (FT1DM) is a clinical condition that is characterized by remarkably rapid and complete pancreatic β-cell destruction, rapid onset of hyperglycemic symptoms followed by ketoacidosis. In most cases this process takes a few days. Although rare, there have been clinical manifestations with a prolonged progress that lasts longer than one week. This study focused on the case of a 35-monthold boy who was referred to our clinic with the diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis, and later had a modest elevation in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels (6.7 %) incompatible with his significantly elevated blood glucose levels. The autoantibodies against pancreatic β-cells were negative. On the basis of these above mentioned findings, our patient was then diagnosed with fulminant type 1 diabetes mellitus. If patients with diabetic ketoacidosis have no elevation in HbA1c levels, they should be assessed for possible clinical factors that can lead to lower detectable levels of HbA1c.

30784225,Bone Morphogenetic Protein-6 Attenuates Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus-Associated Bone Loss.,['Bone loss'],"['Jesse F Wang', 'Ming-Song Lee', 'Tsung-Lin Tsai', 'Ellen M Leiferman', 'Darrin J Trask', 'Matthew W Squire', 'Wan-Ju Li']","Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) often suffer from osteopenia or osteoporosis. Although most agree that T1DM-induced hyperglycemia is a risk factor for progressive bone loss, the mechanisms for the link between T1DM and bone loss still remain elusive. In this study, we found that bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) isolated from T1DM donors were less inducible for osteogenesis than those from non-T1DM donors and further identified a mechanism involving bone morphogenetic protein-6 (BMP6) that was produced significantly less in BMSCs derived from T1DM donors than that in control cells. With addition of exogenous BMP6 in culture, osteogenesis of BMSCs from T1DM donors was restored whereas the treatment of BMP6 seemed not to affect non-T1DM control cells. We also demonstrated that bone mineral density (BMD) was reduced in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice compared with that in control animals, and intraperitoneal injection of BMP6 mitigated bone loss and increased BMD in diabetic mice. Our results suggest that bone formation in T1DM patients is impaired by reduction of endogenous BMP6, and supplementation of BMP6 enhances osteogenesis of BMSCs to restore BMD in a mouse model of T1DM, which provides insight into the development of clinical treatments for T1DM-assocaited bone loss.
