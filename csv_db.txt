36198244,"Management of cutaneous toxicities under amivantamab (anti MET and anti EGFR bispecific antibody) in patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer harboring EGFR Exon20ins: towards a proactive, multidisciplinary approach.","['Amivantamab', 'Dermatological toxicities', 'EGFR mutated', 'Guidelines', 'NSCLC']","Lung cancer (Amsterdam, Netherlands)","The Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) is mutated in 10-15% of patients with lung adenocarcinoma. At metastatic stage EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are used front line for patients harboring targetable mutations. Novel anti-EGFR therapies are being developed. Amivantamab is a bispecific anti-EGFR and anti-MET antibody with expected skin toxicities.
We developed here guidelines for prevention and treatment of cutaneous toxicities under amivantamab according to our experience at Institut Curie.
The first patients with metastatic lung cancer harboring EGFR Exon20ins mutation, included in the phase 1 CHRYSALIS trial and cured at Institute Curie from November 1st 2019 until December 31st 2021 were selected for this work. Retrospectively, all cutaneous adverse events were registered and classified according to the CTCAE 6.0 classification, and actions we implemented to minimize and treat these adverse events were collected. We then developed guidelines based on these datas.
A total of seven patients started amivantamab as monotherapy. The two most frequent dermatological adverse events were: acneiform rash and paronychia (100 % of patients). Other adverse events presented by the patients were reported: modification of hair growth with hypertrichosis in 50 % of men (n = 1/2) and hirsutism in 80 % of women (n = 4/5); skin abrasion of the scalp in 71 % (n = 5/7); and skin fissure in 57 % (n = 4/7). We recommend first a rigorous inspection of the skin and teguments to determine the risk rate to have dryer skin under treatment; second a prevention of paronychia/acneiform rash/and skin fissures with prophylactic tetracycline, skin moisturizing, and hygienic measures starting at least 14 days before treatment initiation; third a particular attention to the psychological impact of skin toxicities with access to psychological support.

Bithalamic glioma often harbors EGFR mutation, and a mutation in H3K27M is rare. Here, we describe five cases of BTGs harboring co-alterations of EGFR and H3K27M and retrospectively analyze the clinical, pathological features, and prognosis of this rare entity.
Clinical data of patients were retrieved, and immunohistochemistry and molecular analyses were performed. Besides, a systematic review of articles was conducted using PubMed, and these screened cases were analyzed in EndNote.
Patients' age ranged from 3 to 9 years (median age: 6 years). The male: female ratio was 3:2. Tremors and disturbed speech were the main clinical presentations. All the masses were located at bilateral thalami, and three patients (3/4) had the more significant thalamic lesion on the left. Two patients harbored insertion mutations in exon 20 of EGFR, one missense mutation in exon 7 of EGFR, and two EGFR amplifications. After a median overall survival of eight months, three patients died of tumor progression finally.
The concomitant alterations of EGFR and H3K27M might indicate a new subtype of DMG, H3K27M-altered. Besides, EGFR alterations could provide potential molecular therapeutic strategies to improve the dismal prognosis of BTGs. Due to the rarity, more cases must be collected for the pathogenesis, treatment, and clinical outcomes of BTGs with double alteration phenotypes.",N/A,"The concomitant alterations of EGFR and H3K27M might indicate a new subtype of DMG, H3K27M-altered.

This prospective, multicenter, observational study included 30 patients with non-small cell lung cancer treated with afatinib, harboring a major EGFR mutation confirmed by tumor tissue biopsy. We collected blood samples for liquid biopsy at diagnosis, intermediate stage, and progressive disease. Tissue and liquid biopsies were examined using Cobas ® EGFR Mutation Test v2.
Liquid biopsy detected EGFR mutations in 63.6% of the patients at diagnosis. The presence of metastasis in the extrathoracic, brain, and adrenal glands correlated positively with the detection of EGFR mutations. Patients with positive EGFR mutations at diagnosis had significantly shorter overall and progression-free survival than patients with negative EGFR mutations. Four of the 18 patients (22.2%) who reached progressive disease had positive EGFR T790M mutations. Three of 10 patients (30.0%) with progressive disease were positive and negative for T790M using tumor re-biopsy and liquid biopsy, respectively. The results of EGFR mutation by tissue re-biopsy were the same as those of liquid biopsy in the three patients who were positive for significant EGFR mutations but negative for the T790M mutation using liquid biopsy at progressing disease. Only two patients were positive for major EGFR mutations at intermediate levels.

This has led to the rapid development of many generations of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs). However, patients treated with third-generation TKIs (osimertinib, avitinib and rociletinib) targeting the EGFR T790M mutation have shown emerging resistances and relapses. Therefore, further molecular understanding of NSCLC mutations, bypass signalling, tumour microenvironment and the existence of cancer stem cells to overcome such resistances is warranted. This will pave the way for designing novel and effective chemotherapies to improve patients' overall survival. In this review, we provide an overview of the multifaceted mechanism of resistances towards EGFR-TKIs, as well as the challenges and perspectives that should be addressed in strategising chemotherapeutic treatments to overcome the ever evolving and adaptive nature of NSCLC.",N/A,,,,Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

36187350,The impact of heme biosynthesis regulation on glioma aggressiveness: Correlations with diagnostic molecular markers.,"['TCGA', 'glioma', 'heme biosynthesis', 'mRNA', 'molecular markers']",Frontiers in molecular neuroscience,"The prognosis of diffusely infiltrating glioma patients is dismal but varies greatly between individuals. While characterization of gliomas primarily relied on histopathological features, molecular markers increasingly gained importance and play a key role in the recently published 5 
In this study, patient data were derived from the ""The Cancer Genome Atlas"" (TCGA) lower-grade glioma and glioblastoma cohorts. We identified diffusely infiltrating gliomas correlating molecular tumor diagnosis according to the most recent WHO classification with heme biosynthesis mRNA expression. The following molecular markers were analyzed: EGFR amplification, TERT promoter mutation, CDKN2A/B homozygous loss, chromosome 7 + /10- aneuploidy, MGMT methylation, IDH mutation, ATRX loss, p53 mutation and 1p19q codeletion. Subsequently, we calculated the heme biosynthesis mRNA expression signature for correlation with distinct molecular glioma markers/molecular subgroups and performed survival analyses.
A total of 649 patients with available data on up-to-date molecular markers and heme biosynthesis mRNA expression were included. According to analysis of individual molecular markers, we found a significantly higher heme biosynthesis mRNA expression signature in gliomas with IDH wildtype (
Our data demonstrate a significant correlation between heme biosynthesis regulation and diagnostic molecular markers and a prognostic relevance independent of these established markers. Consequently, heme biosynthesis expression is a promising biomarker for glioma aggressiveness and might constitute a potential target for novel therapeutic approaches.",N/A,,,,"Copyright © 2022 Mischkulnig, Kiesel, Rötzer-Pejrimovsky, Borkovec, Lang, Millesi, Wadiura, Hervey-Jumper, Penninger, Berger, Widhalm and Erhart.",10.3389/fnmol.2022.928355,2022-10-04,"[{'lastname': 'Mischkulnig', 'firstname': 'Mario', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurosurgery, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.\nCentral Nervous System Tumors Unit, Comprehensive Cancer Center, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.'}, {'lastname': 'Kiesel', 'firstname': 'Barbara', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurosurgery, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.\nCentral Nervous System Tumors Unit, Comprehensive Cancer Center, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.'}, {'lastname': 'Rötzer-Pejrimovsky', 'firstname': 'Thomas', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Central Nervous System Tumors Unit, Comprehensive Cancer Center, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.\nDivision of Neuropathology and Neurochemistry, Department of Neurology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.'}, {'lastname': 'Borkovec', 'firstname': 'Martin', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurosurgery, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.\nDepartment of Statistics, Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich, Munich, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Lang', 'firstname': 'Alexandra', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurosurgery, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.\nCentral Nervous System Tumors Unit, Comprehensive Cancer Center, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.'}, {'lastname': 'Millesi', 'firstname': 'Matthias', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurosurgery, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.\nCentral Nervous System Tumors Unit, Comprehensive Cancer Center, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.'}, {'lastname': 'Wadiura', 'firstname': 'Lisa I', 'initials': 'LI', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurosurgery, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.\nCentral Nervous System Tumors Unit, Comprehensive Cancer Center, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.'}, {'lastname': 'Hervey-Jumper', 'firstname': 'Shawn', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurological Surgery, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Penninger', 'firstname': 'Josef M', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Molecular Biotechnology of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna, Austria.\nDepartment of Medical Genetics, Life Sciences Institute, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Berger', 'firstname': 'Mitchel S', 'initials': 'MS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurological Surgery, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Widhalm', 'firstname': 'Georg', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurosurgery, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.\nCentral Nervous System Tumors Unit, Comprehensive Cancer Center, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.'}, {'lastname': 'Erhart', 'firstname': 'Friedrich', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurosurgery, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.\nCentral Nervous System Tumors Unit, Comprehensive Cancer Center, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.'}]",5
