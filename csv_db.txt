Mental health provision for university students with ADHD is often inadequate due to long waiting times for access to diagnosis and treatment in specialist National Health Service (NHS) clinics. ADHD is a hidden and marginalised disability, and within higher education in the UK, the categorisation of ADHD as a specific learning difference (or difficulty) may be contributing to this."

Transition refers to a transfer to an adult mental health service (AMHS), to private care or other mental health community services. A transition plan can also lead to a managed end of specialized care with involvement of a general practitioner or social services. For young people with a diagnosis of ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) or ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder), two disorders that persist into adulthood, an optimal transition would ensure continuity of care or facilitate access to specialized care in the case of a discharge. Transition typically occurs during adolescence, a known sensitive period when young people may experience major changes at several levels: physiological, psychological and social. Any barrier in the transition process resulting in discontinuity of care may worsen the symptoms of ADHD or ASD and can ultimately adversely affect the global mental health of young people with such neurodevelopmental disorders. The objectives of this narrative review are: 1/to identify the barriers in the transition process in mental health services often faced by young people with these two disorders; 2/to highlight specific recommendations for strengthening the CAMHS-AMHS interface that have been proposed by various countries in Europe."
32167193,Do motor coordination and sleep difficulties predict peer functioning in children and adolescents with attention-deficit and hyperactivity disorder after accounting for existing ADHD symptomology?,"['attention-deficit and hyperactivity disorder', 'motor coordination', 'motor skills', 'peer problems', 'peer relationships']","['Vincent O Mancini', 'Kathryn E Althorpe', 'Wai Chen']","Children with attention-deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are more likely to experience peer problems compared to their non-ADHD peers, though ADHD-specific symptoms only partially explain this association. This study examined whether sleep difficulties and motor coordination problems are additional predictors of peer problems in an ADHD population. An ADHD sample of 72 participants aged 6-14 years (M = 9.86 years, SD = 1.79 years) was evaluated for an association of peer problems with measures of motor coordination, sleep difficulties as well as ADHD and comorbidity symptoms. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis (HMRA) was used to test the current study aims. Motor coordination, but not sleep difficulties, predicted additional variance in peer problems after controlling for inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, internalizing problems, oppositionality, and conduct problems. Poor motor coordination predicts peer problems beyond ADHD symptoms. Clinicians seeking to improve peer functioning in children with ADHD should also consider motor coordination difficulties in addition to existing treatment strategies. Statement of contribution What is already known Children with attention-deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) experience greater peer problems (i.e., making friends, being victimized, participating in play) than their typically developing peers. Previous studies have attributed this association between ADHD and peer problems to the symptoms of ADHD (i.e., inattention and/or hyperactivity) disrupting the typical trajectory of social development. However, quantitative studies have identified that symptoms of ADHD predict only portion of the variance in a child's peer problems - highlighting that there may be other unique factors that contribute to the higher incidence of peer problems typically observed in this population. What this study adds This study tested whether additional theoretically relevant factors could predict levels of peer problems in children with ADHD beyond the primary symptoms of the disorder. Internalizing symptomatology, conduct problems, oppositionality, motor coordination, and sleep difficulties were added to a regression model already including inattention and hyperactivity symptoms. These factors explained 51% of the variability in peer problems. In this sample of 72 ADHD children, the results of the final model highlighted that only motor coordination and conduct problems remained significant predictors of peer problems - highlighting two potentially important target areas for screening and intervention."

In this study, we sought to assess the role of rare recurrent variants in non-European populations and outside of coding regions. We generated whole genome sequence (WGS) data on 875 individuals, including 205 ADHD cases and 670 non-ADHD controls. The cases included 116 African Americans (AA) and 89 European Americans (EA), and the controls included 408 AA and 262 EA. Multiple novel rare recurrent variants were identified in exonic regions, functionally classified as stop-gains and frameshifts for known ADHD genes. Deletion in introns of the protocadherins families and the ncRNA <i>HGB8P</i> were identified in two independent EA ADHD patients. A meta-analysis of the two ethnicities for differential ADHD recurrent variants compared to controls shows a small number of overlaps. These results suggest that rare recurrent variants in noncoding regions may be involved in the pathogenesis of ADHD in children of both AA and EA ancestry; thus, WGS could be a powerful discovery tool for studying the molecular mechanisms of ADHD."

A structured diagnostic interview specific to ADHD provides a globally agreed-on standard of evaluation. These interviews are accessible in the public domain in multiple languages and are helpful to clinicians new to the diagnosis of ADHD. Broad-based rating scales looking at multiple domains of psychopathology are critical to assuring recognition of comorbid diagnoses, which might otherwise be missed, differential diagnoses, and identification of the most prominent or treatable diagnosis. Recent innovations in computerized adaptive testing have improved the efficiency and accuracy of diagnostic screening. Rating scales specific to ADHD and disruptive behavior disorders establish the severity of the disorder and response to intervention. Age- and gender-normed symptom rating scales for ADHD capture clinically salient differences between what is normative in different demographic groups. An evaluation of functional impairment in ADHD has been critical to understanding the patient's perspective of the presenting problem. Best practice care for ADHD treatment goes beyond improvement to well-defined standards for both symptom and functional remission. Studies of executive function, emotional regulation, mind-wandering, and sluggish cognitive tempo have led to a richer understanding of the breadth and depth of associated deficits commonly experienced by ADHD patients. Psychometrically validated tools are available to complement every aspect of ADHD care and provide global standards for research."

34721828,Meta-Analysis Study on Treatment of Children's Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity.,[],"['Jinlian Xue', 'Yuping Hao', 'Xiaohui Li', 'Renfang Guan', 'Yang Wang', 'Yanfang Li', 'Hongni Tian']","With the development of society and the economy, the prevalence of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been increasing. Due to its high comorbidity and high harm, it has received increasing attention. It causes damage to functions in multiple areas, and this damage may continue into adulthood. ADHD is a common developmental disorder characterized by persistent attention deficit and hyperactivity/impulsivity. ADHD often merges with other diseases, such as oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, personality disorder, anxiety disorder, mood disorder, and substance dependence. The disease tends to cause children with learning difficulties, poor grades, strained relationships with family members and children of the same age, lack of self-esteem, and children with low occupation, low income, substance abuse, and antisocial personality characteristics when they grow up to adults. Many countries have formulated ADHD treatment guidelines for this purpose, but there is still a lack of consensus. This article uses literature research and the meta method: RevMan 5.3 software is used for data analysis. The analysis results show that traditional Chinese medicine has characteristics and advantages in the clinical total effective rate and hyperactivity index score in the treatment of ADHD. The overall clinical syndrome differentiation of the treatment can be summarized as liver and kidney yin deficiency and liver yang partial prosperity. The overall medication is based on the methods of nourishing yin and clearing heat, calming the liver and nourishing kidney, and nourishing yin and suppressing yang. The efficacy and safety evaluation of traditional Chinese medicine in the treatment of ADHD need to be further verified by large-sample clinical trials with strict design and standardized outcome index reporting."

In contrast with many European countries, the identification and management of adult ADHD remains underdeveloped in France, and a subject of controversy. This review provides a practical update on current knowledge about ADHD in adults for French-speaking professionals who have to detect or manage adult patients with ADHD. ADHD is classified as a neurodevelopmental disorder in the recent update of the international diagnostic classification. While symptoms and impairment due to ADHD are frequently severe during childhood, they often evolve as children grow older, with frequent persistent disabilities in adulthood. In adulthood, the clinical presentation, as in childhood, involves the symptom triad of inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity. However, differences are noted: hyperactivity is more often internalized, symptoms of inattention may be masked by anxiety symptoms or obsessive-like compensation strategies. ADHD is often diagnosed during childhood, but it is not rare for the diagnosis to be made later. Failure to recognise symptoms resulting in misdiagnosis, or alternatively well-developed compensation factors could be two underlying reasons for the long delay until diagnosis. Other symptoms, such as emotional deregulation or executive function-related symptoms are also usually observed in adults. In addition, in adults, ADHD is often associated with other psychiatric disorders (in 80% of cases); this makes the diagnosis even more difficult. These disorders encompass a broad spectrum, from mood disorders (unipolar or bipolar), to anxiety disorders, and other neurodevelopmental disorders and personality disorders, especially borderline and antisocial personality disorder. Substance-use disorders are very common, either as a consequence of impulsivity and emotional dysregulation or as an attempt at self-treatment. Sleep disorders, especially restless leg syndrome and hypersomnolence, could share common pathophysiological mechanisms with ADHD. ADHD and comorbidity-related symptoms are responsible for serious functional impairment, in various domains, leading to academic, social, vocational, and familial consequences. The impact on other psychiatric disorders as an aggravating factor should also be considered. The considerable disability and the poorer quality of life among adults with ADHD warrant optimal evaluation and management. The diagnostic procedure for ADHD among adults should be systematic. Once the positive diagnosis is made, the evaluation enables characterisation of the levels of severity and impairment at individual level. A full examination should also assess medical conditions associated with ADHD, to provide personalized care. In recent years, a growing number of assessment tools have been translated and validated in French providing a wide range of structured interviews and standardized self-report questionnaires for the evaluation of core and associated ADHD symptoms, comorbidities and functional impairment. The treatment of ADHD in adults is multimodal, and aims to relieve the symptoms, limit the burden of the disease, and manage comorbidities. The most relevant and validated psychological approaches are psycho-education, cognitive-behavioural therapy and ""third wave therapies"" with a specific focus on emotional regulation. Cognitive remediation and neurofeedback are promising strategies still under evaluation. Medications, especially psychostimulants, are effective for alleviating ADHD symptoms with a large effect size. Their safety and tolerance are satisfactory, although their long-term clinical benefit is still under discussion. In France, methylphenidate is the only stimulant available for the treatment of ADHD. Unfortunately, there is no authorization for its use among adults except in continuation after adolescence. Hence the prescription, which is subject to the regulations on narcotics, is off-label in France. This article aims to provide practical considerations for the management of ADHD and associated disorders in adults, in this particular French context."

Additionally, 18,959 partners of patients aged ≥18 years with ADHD were identified, and compared with 74,032 control partners. Direct costs were based on data from the Danish Ministry of Health. Information about the use and costs of drugs were obtained from the Danish Medicines Agency. The frequencies of visits and hospitalizations, and costs of general practice were derived from data from the National Health Security. Indirect costs were obtained from Coherent Social Statistics. The average annual health care costs for people with ADHD and their partners were, respectively, €2636 and €477 higher than those of the matched controls. A greater percentage of people with ADHD and their partners compared with respective control subjects received social services (sick pay or disability pension). Those with ADHD had a lower income from employment than did controls for equivalent periods up to five years before the first diagnosis of ADHD.

ADHD impairments arise from irregularities primarily in dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE) circuits within the prefrontal cortex. Due to ADHD medication's controversial side effects and high rates of diagnosis, alternative/complementary pharmacological therapeutic approaches for ADHD are needed. Although the number of publications that study the potential effects of caffeine consumption on ADHD treatment have been accumulating over the last years, and caffeine has recently been used in ADHD research in the context of animal models, an updated evidence-based systematic review on the effects of caffeine on ADHD-like symptoms in animal studies is lacking. To provide insight and value at the preclinical level, a systematic review based on PRISMA guidelines was performed for all publications available up to 1 September 2021. Caffeine treatment increases attention and improves learning, memory, and olfactory discrimination without altering blood pressure and body weight. These results are supported at the neuronal/molecular level. Nonetheless, the role of caffeine in modulating ADHD-like symptoms of hyperactivity and impulsivity is contradictory, raising discrepancies that require further clarification. Our results strengthen the hypothesis that the cognitive effects of caffeine found in animal models could be translated to human ADHD, particularly during adolescence."

The goal of the present study was to investigate the effect of treatment with RehaCom on auditory and visual response control, and auditory and visual attention in children with ADHD. Forty patients were selected. The participants were assigned to control (n = 20) and experimental (n = 20) groups, while only the participants in the experimental group were trained by RehaCom for five weeks (ten 45-min sessions, two sessions per week). At weeks 0 and 5, performance of the participants of experimental group was compared with the participants of control group. The results showed that treatment with RehaCom significantly improved auditory and visual response control in children with ADHD, with no effect on auditory and visual attention. In conclusion, RehaCom may alter brain's structural and functional properties that are related to response control. We suggest that attention deficit in ADHD may be a result of more complicated dysfunctions in the brain, that are not affected by RehaCom."

Additionally, the seasonal trends of ADHD incidence and ADHD prevalence were determined. (2) Methods: A population-based observational retrospective study, which included people born between 1991 and 2011 and who attended compulsory education between 2007 and 2017 in Navarre (Spain), was carried out with data from both the Education and Health Department databases. (3) Results: The incidence rate increased from 4.18 cases per 1000 person-years in 2003 to 7.43 cases per 1000 person-years in 2009, before decreasing progressively to 2.1 cases per 1000 person-years in 2019. A peak incidence rate at 7-8 years of age was observed, which is consistent across the study period and for both genders. Males were more than twice as likely to be diagnosed with ADHD than females, with similar time trends in both. A seasonal pattern in ADHD diagnosis was found, with peaks in February-March and the lowest rates in the summer months. Inattentive cases were much more frequent than hyperactive cases, whereas combined cases remained low across the study period.

Guanfacine extended-release (GXR) is a non-psychostimulant ADHD drug that is a selective α2A-adrenergic receptor agonist, first approved for treatment of adult ADHD in Japan in June 2019. Our aim was to provide an overview of GXR pharmacology and review the studies on efficacy and safety that have been conducted in adults with ADHD. The beneficial actions of guanfacine are thought to be attributed to the strengthening of prefrontal cortical network connections, which regulate attention, emotion, and behavior via the activity at post-synaptic α2A receptors. Current evidence of GXR efficacy and safety suggests that GXR is an effective monotherapy treatment option for adults with ADHD."

Time-frequency analyses capturing event-related power modulations are becoming an increasingly popular approach, but a systematic synthesis of the time-frequency literature in ADHD is currently lacking. We conducted the first systematic review and meta-analysis of time-frequency studies of children and adults with ADHD in comparison to neurotypical controls. Searches via Medline, Embase, and Web of Science, as well as reference lists, identified 28 eligible articles published until March 2021. Of these, 13 articles with relevant data were included in a multi-level meta-analysis. Most studies examined power modulations of alpha, theta and/or beta frequencies (N = 21/28), and focused on children (N = 17/28). Meta-analyses showed significantly weaker theta increases (Cohen's d = -0.25, p = 0.039; N<sub>ADHD</sub> = 346, N<sub>CONTROL</sub> = 327), alpha decreases (d = 0.44, p < 0.001; N<sub>ADHD</sub> = 564, N<sub>CONTROL</sub> = 450), and beta increases (Cohen's d = -0.33, p < 0.001; N<sub>ADHD</sub> = 222, N<sub>CONTROL</sub> = 263) in individuals with ADHD relative to controls. These patterns indicate broad brain-oscillatory alterations in individuals with ADHD with small (theta) and small-to-moderate (alpha and beta) effect sizes. These group differences were partly consistent when repeating analyses by age group (<18 and 18+ years) and task type (cognitive control, working memory, and simple attention tasks). Overall, our findings identify widespread event-related brain-oscillatory alterations in individuals with ADHD during a range of neurocognitive functions. Future research requires larger samples, a broader range of frequency bands (including delta and gamma) during a wider type of cognitive-affective processes, and should clarify whether atypical event-related power profiles are ADHD-specific or shared with other neuropsychiatric conditions."

There is recent evidence that both disorders are somehow related and that genes may play a large role in these disorders. Despite mounting human and animal research, the neurological pathways underlying ASD and ADHD are still not well understood. Scientists investigate neurodevelopmental disorders by using animal models that have high similarities in genetics and behaviours with humans. Mice have been utilized in neuroscience research as an excellent animal model for a long time; however, the zebrafish has attracted much attention recently, with an increasingly large number of studies using this model. In this review, we first discuss ASD and ADHD aetiology from a general point of view to their characteristics and treatments. We also compare mice and zebrafish for their similarities and discuss their advantages and limitations in neuroscience. Finally, we summarize the most recent and existing research on zebrafish and mouse models of ASD and ADHD. We believe that this review will serve as a unique document providing interesting information to date about these models, thus facilitating research on ASD and ADHD."

In childhood, this disorder is more common in boys than in girls, and at least 75% will continue to suffer from the disorder until adulthood. Individuals with ADHD generally have poor academic, occupational, and social functioning resulting from developmentally inappropriate levels of hyperactivity and impulsivity, as well as impaired ability to maintain attention on motivationally relevant tasks. Very few drugs available in clinical practice altogether abolish the symptoms of ADHD, therefore, to find new drugs and target it is essential to understand the neuropathological, neurochemical, and genetic alterations that lead to the progression of ADHD. With this contrast, an animal study is the best approach because animal models provide relatively fast invasive manipulation, rigorous hypothesis testing, as well as it provides a better angle to understand the pathological mechanisms involved in disease progression. Moreover, animal models, especially for ADHD, serve with good predictive validity would allow the assessment and development of new therapeutic interventions, with this aim, the present review collect the various animal models on a single platform so that the research can select an appropriate model to pursue his study."

It is unclear whether ADHD increases the risk of non-affective psychotic disorder (NAPD). The study included a matched cohort, drawn from all born in Sweden 1987-1991 (n = 548,852). ADHD was defined as ICD diagnosis and/or prescription of ADHD medication. We distinguished between stimulants and non-stimulants, and usage duration (<1 year, 1-2 years and ≥2 years). We calculated odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for NAPD, adjusted for confounders, comorbid autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and substance abuse. ADHD cases were also compared to their unaffected full siblings. We analyzed 18,139 ADHD cases and 72,437 sex and birth year matched controls. NAPD was more common in cases than controls (2.7 and 0.4%, respectively). After adjustment for confounders, ADHD cases had markedly high risk for NAPD (OR: 6.99; 95% CI 6.03-8.10), which attenuated further after adjustment for ASD and substance abuse (OR: 2.57; 95% CI 2.09-3.16). Utilization of ADHD medication increased the risk for NAPD (ORs for change in odds of NAPD for every 5 extra prescriptions of stimulants 1.06 (95% CI 1.02-1.10) and, non-stimulants 1.15 (95% CI 1.01-1.30)). There was no association between usage length of medication and risk for NAPD. The risk was higher in individuals with ADHD than their unaffected siblings (OR: 2.95 (95% CI 2.07-4.20)). Overall, ADHD was associated with elevated risk for NAPD, which is not entirely explained by shared familial factors. The clinical severity leading to medical treatment may also increase NAPD risk.

Three small studies piloted neurofeedback of frontal activations in ADHD using functional magnetic resonance imaging or near-infrared spectroscopy, finding no superior effects over control conditions. Brain stimulation has been applied to ADHD using mostly repetitive transcranial magnetic and direct current stimulation (rTMS/tDCS). rTMS has shown mostly negative findings on improving cognition or symptoms. Meta-analyses of tDCS studies targeting mostly the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex show small effects on cognitive improvements with only two out of three studies showing clinical improvements. Trigeminal nerve stimulation has been shown to improve ADHD symptoms with medium effect in one RCT. Modern neurotherapeutics are attractive due to their relative safety and potential neuroplastic effects. However, they need to be thoroughly tested for clinical and cognitive efficacy across settings and beyond core symptoms and for their potential for individualised treatment."

We conducted bi-directional MR on ADHD liability and six obesity-related traits using summary statistics from the largest available meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies. We also examined the shared genetic aetiology between ADHD symptoms (inattention and hyperactivity) and body mass index (BMI) by PRS association analysis using longitudinal data from Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1986 (NFBC1986, n = 2984). Lastly, we examined the impact of the prenatal environment by association analysis of maternal pre-pregnancy BMI and offspring ADHD symptoms, adjusted for PRS of both traits, in NFBC1986 dataset. Through MR analyses, we found evidence for bidirectional causality between ADHD liability and obesity-related traits. PRS association analyses showed evidence for genetic overlap between ADHD symptoms and BMI. We found no evidence for a difference between inattention and hyperactivity symptoms, suggesting that neither symptom subtype is driving the association. We found evidence for association between maternal pre-pregnancy BMI and offspring ADHD symptoms after adjusting for both BMI and ADHD PRS (association p-value = 0.027 for inattention, p = 0.008 for hyperactivity). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the co-occurrence between ADHD and obesity has both genetic and prenatal environmental origins."

The results indicate that elementary schoolteachers in northern Jordan have negative perceptions regarding ADHD and its causes, treatment, and diagnosis. The lack of professional pre-service training and education about children's behavioral problems overall, but especially regarding ADHD knowledge and management of children with ADHD was found to be deficient among our sample of elementary schoolteachers. The pronounced lack of research on teacher management of ADHD in children in Jordan may have contributed to these findings.

Children 8-13 were recruited in three groups: 23 ADHD+PAE, 19 familial ADHD-PAE, and 28 typically developing controls (TD). Neurobehavioral instruments included the Conners 3 Parent Behavior Rating Scale and the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS). Two dimensional magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging was acquired from supraventricular white matter to measure N-acetylaspartate compounds, glutamate, creatine + phosphocreatine (creatine), and choline-compounds (choline). Whole brain diffusion tensor imaging was acquired and used to to calculate fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity, and radial diffusivity from the same superventricular white matter regions that produced magnetic resonance spectroscopy data. The Conners 3 Parent Hyperactivity/Impulsivity Score, glutamate, mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity, and radial diffusivity were all higher in ADHD+PAE than ADHD-PAE. Glutamate was lower in ADHD-PAE than TD. Within ADHD+PAE, inferior performance on the D-KEFS Tower Test correlated with higher neurometabolite levels. These findings suggest white matter differences between the PAE and familial etiologies of ADHD. Abnormalities detected by magnetic resonance spectroscopy and diffusion tensor imaging co-localize in supraventricular white matter and are relevant to executive function symptoms of ADHD."

The mean serum 25OHD concentration (16.57 ± 9.09 ng/mL) was found to be significantly lower in ADHD children with more parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels as compared to controls (22.01 ± 12.67ng/mL). The sufficient 25OHD concentration was more predominant in the controls than the cases (p = 0.002). A severe deficiency of vitamin D was more found in children with ADHD (3.36 times). There was a negative and significant association between the participants' age and their serum 25OHD levels. Although 25OHD levels in boys were significantly more than those in girls, the reduction of serum 25OHD concentration among boys with ADHD was more severe compared to the patient girls(p = 0.014). The results support the importance of vitamins D role in ADHD patients through the regular monitoring of serum 25OHD levels."
31177787,Novel approach to evaluate central autonomic regulation in attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).,[],"['N Sekaninova', 'M Mestanik', 'A Mestanikova', 'A Hamrakova', 'I Tonhajzerova']","Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most commonly diagnosed developmental disorders in childhood characterized by hyperactivity, impulsivity and inattention. ADHD manifests in the child's development by deficits in cognitive, executive and perceptor-motor functions, emotional regulation and social adaptation. Although the exact cause has not yet been known, the crucial role in the development of this disease plays the interaction of genetic, neurobiological and epigenetic factors. According to current knowledge, ADHD is defined as a biological dysfunction of central nervous system with genetically or organically defined deficits in noradrenergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission associated with structural abnormalities, especially in prefronto-striatal regions. In this context, a significant part of the difficulties could be due to a faulty control of fronto-striato-thalamo-cortical circuits important for attention, arousal and executive functions. Moreover, ADHD is associated with abnormal autonomic regulation. Specifically, reduced cardiac-linked parasympathetic activity associated with relative sympathetic dominance indexed by low heart rate variability can represent a noninvasive marker for prefrontal hypoactivity. However, the mechanisms underlying altered autonomic regulation in ADHD are still unknown. In this aspect, the evaluation of central autonomic regulation by noninvasive methods, namely pupillometry and eye-tracking, may provide novel information for better understanding of the neurobiological pathomechanisms leading to ADHD."

Incidence and hazard ratios of subsequent psychiatric disorders were compared after a maximum follow-up of 9 years. The incidence of psychiatric disorders was 1.4-fold greater in the SI cohort, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.41 (95% confidence interval 1.20-1.67), comparing to the non-SI cohort. Risks were elevated for emotional disturbances, conduct disorders, and adjustment disorders independent of age, gender, or comorbidity. Among children with only psychosocial intervention, the incidence of psychiatric disorders was 3.5-fold greater in the SI cohort than in the non-SI cohort. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report an increased risk of developing psychiatric disorders for children with ADHD who received SI compared to those who did not. Potential adverse effects of SI for ADHD children should be carefully examined and discussed before practice."

The Adult Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder Scale (AADHDS), the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET), and the Metacognitions Questionnaire-30 (MCQ-30) were administered. Results indicated that patients with ADHD had worse metacognitions scores, in specific subdimensions, relative to healthy controls. However, cognitive flexibility and emotion recognition did not differ between the groups. Moreover, the cognitive confidence subdimension of the MCQ-30 was found to be sole significant predictor in the attention deficit subdimension of the AADHDS. Our findings suggest that lack of cognitive confidence may contribute to ADHD symptomatology despite regularly functioning cognitive flexibility and emotion recognition.

ADHD and SUD also frequently co-occur in treatment-seeking adolescents, which complicates diagnosis and treatment and is associated with poor treatment outcomes. Research on the effect of treatment of childhood ADHD on the prevention of adolescent SUD is inconclusive, and studies on the diagnosis and treatment of adolescents with ADHD and SUD are scarce. Thus, the available evidence is generally not sufficient to justify robust treatment recommendations. <i>Objective:</i> The aim of the study was to obtain a consensus statement based on a combination of scientific data and clinical experience. <i>Method:</i> A modified Delphi study to reach consensus based upon the combination of scientific data and clinical experience with a multidisciplinary group of 55 experts from 17 countries. The experts were asked to rate a set of statements on the effect of treatment of childhood ADHD on adolescent SUD and on the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of adolescents with comorbid ADHD and SUD. <i>Results:</i> After 3 iterative rounds of rating and adapting 37 statements, consensus was reached on 36 of these statements representing 6 domains: general (<i>n</i> = 4), risk of developing SUD (<i>n</i> = 3), screening and diagnosis (<i>n</i> = 7), psychosocial treatment (<i>n</i> = 5), pharmacological treatment (<i>n</i> = 11), and complementary treatments (<i>n</i> = 7). Routine screening is recommended for ADHD in adolescent patients in substance abuse treatment and for SUD in adolescent patients with ADHD in mental healthcare settings. Long-acting stimulants are recommended as the first-line treatment of ADHD in adolescents with concurrent ADHD and SUD, and pharmacotherapy should preferably be embedded in psychosocial treatment. The only remaining no-consensus statement concerned the requirement of abstinence before starting pharmacological treatment in adolescents with ADHD and concurrent SUD. In contrast to the majority, some experts required full abstinence before starting any pharmacological treatment, some were against the use of stimulants in the treatment of these patients (independent of abstinence), while some were against the alternative use of bupropion. <i>Conclusion:</i> This international consensus statement can be used by clinicians and patients together in a shared decision-making process to select the best interventions and to reach optimal outcomes in adolescent patients with concurrent ADHD and SUD."

ADHD in preschool-age children has a profound impact on psychosocial function and developmental trajectory. Clinical studies on pharmacotherapies for ADHD in young children have expanded rapidly in the past 2 decades, providing some evidence of efficacy for both psychostimulant and non-psychostimulant medications. However, preschool children may be more susceptible to adverse effects of medications, including growth reduction and cardiovascular side effects. Many questions remain regarding the long-term safety and effectiveness of these interventions; thus more research is needed to help clinicians evaluate the risk-benefit ratio for preschoolers with ADHD. As this body of knowledge grows, providers should consider the level of impairment caused by current symptoms in the risk-benefit analysis. Families should be educated not just about potential effects of medication but known complications of untreated ADHD; parents will likely not fully appreciate the long-term psychological effects of chronic behavioral problems and underachievement on a young child. A blanket ""wait and see"" approach should be avoided, in order to prevent a permanent loss of self-esteem and motivation that may affect some children throughout their lifespan."

Droxidopa, also known as L-threo-dihydroxyphenylserine (L-DOPS), is a norepinephrine prodrug that enhances brain norepinephrine and dopamine levels. In this study, we used electrophysiological tests to examine effects of L-DOPS on the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area. We also conducted behavioral tests to assess L-DOPS' effects on ADHD-like behaviors in rats. In chloral hydrate-anesthetized rats, PFC local field potentials oscillated between the active, depolarized UP state and the hyperpolarized DOWN state. Mimicking the effect of d-amphetamine, L-DOPS, given after the peripheral amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, benserazide (BZ), increased the amount of time the PFC spent in the UP state, indicating an excitatory effect of L-DOPS on PFC neurons. Like d-amphetamine, L-DOPS also inhibited dopamine neurons, an effect significantly reversed by the D2-like receptor antagonist raclopride. In the behavioral tests, BZ + L-DOPS improved hyperactivity, inattention and impulsive action of the adolescent spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR/NCrl), well-validated animal model of the combined type of ADHD.

BZ + L-DOPS ameliorated ADHD-like behaviors in rats suggesting its potential as an alternative ADHD treatment."

Looking into the history of psychiatry can make an enlightening contribution here. Guided by this aim and specifically following literature referred to by Emil Kraepelin (1856-1926), we analyzed the content of one study each by Gustav Specht (1860-1940) and the later Nazi psychiatrist Hermann Paul Nitsche (1876-1948) from 1905 and 1910, respectively, on the topic of chronic mania. Our investigation concluded that in their case studies both authors described people who would today be diagnosed as suffering from adult ADHD as the clinical descriptions reveal core symptoms of this entity as defined by modern classifications. They also mentioned currently discussed research questions. Both authors expressed their dissatisfaction with the classificatory situation of these patients at the time. Specht even postulated a ""completely independent mental illness"" that he called ""chronic mania"", under which he classified all the patients suffering from today's adult ADHD. He also pointed out that this diagnosis was not widely recognized at the time by psychiatrists as a full-fledged form of illness but used more as a diagnosis to avoid the embarrassment of not having one. Nitsche saw the ""chronic manic states"" as he called them as a ""clinical peculiarity"" but assigned them to the large group of ""manic depressive insanity"", which could only be more finely differentiated in the future."

Among them, 2655 were diagnosed with ADHD, while the remaining 8669 were recruited as healthy controls. All eight trials reported significantly lower serum concentrations of 25(OH)D in patients diagnosed with ADHD compared to healthy controls. The pooled data showed that there was a significant difference between the ADHD group and the control group (SMD = - 0.73, 95% CI [- 1.00, - 0.46]). The systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies demonstrated an inverse association between serum 25(OH)D and young patients with ADHD. Large cohort studies are required to investigate whether vitamin D-deficient infants are more likely to develop ADHD in the future. Also, whether children with ADHD should be supplemented with higher doses of vitamin D3 remains to be confirmed through long-term controlled clinical trials."

I highlight causal factors, underlying mechanisms, developmental trajectories, and female manifestations of ADHD, integrating the psychobiological underpinnings of this syndrome with contextual factors related to its clinical presentation, impairments, and soaring increases in diagnosed prevalence. Indeed, despite strong heritability, ADHD is expressed via transactional patterns of influence linked to family-, school-, peer-, neighborhood-, and policy-related factors. Moreover, intervention strategies must take into account both pharmacologic and behavioral modalities if the goal is to enhance competencies, rather than symptom reduction per se. A comprehensive understanding of ADHD mandates multiple levels of analysis-spanning genes, neurotransmission, brain pathways, individual skill levels, family socialization, peer relationships, and educational and cultural forces-which must be integrated and synthesized to surpass reductionist accounts, reduce stigma, and maximize the impact of prevention- and intervention-related efforts."

In this observational study among 21 participants, age 7-16 years, we performed a replicated time-series analysis of symptom fluctuations in asthma and/or allergic rhinitis and ADHD. Data were collected through parents who filled in a daily online questionnaire during up to 50 days. In each individual, we investigated the temporal order of fluctuations in atopic disease symptoms and ADHD symptoms using a vector autoregressive (VAR) model while using sleep problems and medication use as covariates. For 16 out of 21 participants, we constructed a VAR model. For a majority of the participants, significant associations were detected between atopic disease symptoms and ADHD symptoms. The results were heterogeneous; the direction, sign, and timing of the relationship between ADHD, atopy, sleep problems, and medication use varied between individuals. This study provides additional evidence that the symptom expression of atopy and ADHD are related. However, the connection between both diseases in children is found to be heterogeneous within our study population."

Treatment of DSPS may improve both the circadian rhythm and ADHD symptoms. In this three-armed randomized clinical trial, 51 adults (18-55 y) with ADHD and DSPS received sleep education and 3 weeks of (1) 0.5 mg/d placebo, (2) 0.5 mg/d melatonin, or (3) 0.5 mg/d melatonin plus 30 minutes of 10,000 lux bright light therapy (BLT) between 07:00 and 08:00 h. Placebo/melatonin conditions were double-blind. Treatment took place in the participants' naturalistic home settings. Dim-light melatonin onset (DLMO) was measured in saliva as marker of internal circadian rhythm. Melatonin or placebo administration followed individual schedules, starting 3 hours before the individual DLMO and weekly advancing by 1 h. DLMO and ADHD Rating Scale score were assessed at baseline, directly after 3-week treatment, and two weeks after the end of treatment. Results show that at baseline 77% had a DLMO after 21:00 h with an average DLMO at 23:43 h ± 1h46. Directly after treatment, melatonin had advanced DLMO by 1h28 (<i>p</i> = .001), and melatonin plus BLT by 1h58 (<i>p</i> < .001). Placebo did not affect DLMO. ADHD symptoms reduced by 14% (<i>p</i> = .038) directly after melatonin treatment. Placebo and melatonin plus BLT did not impact ADHD symptoms. Two weeks after end of treatment, ADHD symptoms and DLMO had returned to baseline levels. It can be concluded that low doses of melatonin advanced the circadian rhythm and reduced self-reported ADHD symptoms. Given the large number of adult ADHD patients with concurrent DSPS, treating delayed sleep with melatonin is an important component of effective ADHD treatment."

In adults, the disorder is frequently accompanied by Emotional Dysregulation (ED), associated to a variety of related psychiatric comorbidities, complicating its recognition and treatment management. <b>Areas covered</b>: This paper reviews randomized active comparator-controlled or placebo-controlled trials evaluating the use of pharmacotherapy in adults with ADHD and ED, other neurodevelopmental disorders, Bipolar Disorder (BD) and Anxiety Disorders (ADs). When controlled data are unavailable, the authors have included open-label and observational studies. <b>Expert opinion</b>: ED in adult patients with ADHD is a very common and impairing problem that can be treated with stimulants or atomoxetine. ADHD studies in adults with other neurodevelopment disorders are scarce; stimulants seem to be the most effective and safe drugs in treating ADHD symptoms, without worsening the core features of other neurodevelopmental disorders. In patients with ADHD and comorbid BD, the treatment of BD alone may result in residual symptoms of ADHD. Patients should be treated hierarchically: BD should be treated first, while ADHD should be treated combining ADHD medications and mood stabilizers after mood stabilization. The available evidence for treating patients with ADHD and comorbid ADs in adults supports the idea of an anti-anxiety/ADHD-specific treatment association."

Recent work underlines the importance in understanding the role of emotion reactivity and regulatory deficits in the context of the disorder. One study (i.e., Musser et al. 2011) utilized a positive and negative emotion induction and suppression task, as well as indexes of autonomic nervous system reactivity, to examine emotional functioning in youth with ADHD. This study revealed inflexible parasympathetic-based regulation across emotion conditions among youth with ADHD compared to typically developing youth. The present study sought to replicate and extend these findings to a clinically recruited, diverse sample, while also examining sympathetic functioning. Two hundred fifty-nine participants (160 youth with ADHD), aged 5 to 13, completed the task utilized in Musser et al. 2011, while indexes of parasympathetic (i.e., respiratory sinus arrhythmia [RSA]) and sympathetic (i.e., pre-ejection period [PEP] and electrodermal activity [EDA]) reactivity were obtained. ADHD was associated with significantly elevated parasympathetic (i.e., augmented RSA) and sympathetic (as indexed by EDA) reactivity. Overall, results replicate and extend Musser et al. 2011, revealing sympathetic-linked disruptions in emotion reactivity and parasympathetic-linked disruptions in emotion regulation among youth with ADHD. Future studies of behavioral therapies for ADHD should consider the efficacy of adding an emotion regulation skills training component."

Research-based treatment recommendations primarily support Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), an extension of the cognitive behavioural theory, which promotes a deficit-focused characterisation of ADHD and prioritises symptom reduction and cognitive control of self-regulation as treatment outcomes. A wide variety of approaches have developed to improve ADHD outcomes in adults, and this review aimed to map the theoretical foundations of treatment design to understand their impact. A scoping review and analysis were performed on 221 documents to compare the theoretical influences in research, treatment approach, and theoretical citations. Results showed that despite variation in the application, current treatments characterise ADHD from a single paradigm of cognitive behavioural theory. A single theoretical perspective is limiting research for effective treatments for ADHD to address ongoing issues such as accommodating context variability and heterogeneity. Research into alternative theoretical characterisations of ADHD is recommended to provide treatment design opportunities to better understand and address symptoms."

Significant differences between ADHD and TD groups in the WISC-IV GAI scores were found in children but not in adolescents. Children and adolescents with both ADHD presentations performed poorly on the PRS index, while on the WM index only children exhibited difficulties. In the attention test, children with ADHD-C showed more impulsivity and more difficulties for processing speed, concentration and accuracy than ADHD-I and TD. In addition, both ADHD presentations had higher inattention scores than TD. ADHD adolescents performed worse than TD in processing speed, concentration and accuracy. ADHD groups showed more impulsivity and inattention than TD. Digit Span and Symbol Search (WISC-IV) and processing speed and accuracy (d2) successfully classified ADHD and TD in children, but in adolescents, only coding (WISC-IV) and accuracy (d2) successfully classified ADHD presentations and TD. The WISC-IV and d2 yield neuropsychological profiles which reflect age-related cognitive changes and may allow the adaptation of more tailored early interventions for ADHD."

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the relationships between LUTS and ADHD in children. We searched for articles published between January 1990 and July 2019, in PubMed, CENTRAL, and PsycNet. Two authors independently screened all articles and extracted data. We performed random-effect meta-analyses for ADHD with pooled outcomes for LUTS. We identified 119 relevant articles in the literature and 18 articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria for the systematic review, of which, 5 articles had sufficient data for meta-analysis. Examining ADHD among individuals with LUTS, the odds ratio was 2.99 (95% CI 1.13, 7.88, p < 0.001), compared to controls. In multiple studies, the mean overall score for LUTS, using a standardized measure, was significantly higher in patients with ADHD in comparison to controls, and the severity of ADHD was positively associated with the severity of LUTS. Younger age in children was correlated with a higher LUTS score. Different subtypes of urinary incontinence demonstrated differences in behavioral problems and psychiatric comorbidity. Sex differences in LUTS were not consistent across articles. Our results indicate clinically significant associations between ADHD and LUTS in children. Because LUTS and ADHD are common disorders in children, clinicians should be aware of these associations as they inform optimal assessment and treatment strategies."

Parents and teachers of the children completed the Conners Parent Rating Scale Revised Long Form (CPRS-LF) and Conners Teacher Rating Scale Revised Long Form (CTRS-LF). There were no statistically significant differences regarding the age, gender, and sociodemographic data of the groups. Serum ubiquinone levels of the ADHD group were significantly lower than the control group. We did not find any correlation between ubiquinone levels and clinical values. Since ubiquinone levels are lower in children with ADHD compared with controls, we suggest that decreased antioxidant levels may play a role in ADHD pathogenesis by disrupting oxidative balance."
