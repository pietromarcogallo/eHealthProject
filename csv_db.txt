Secondly, to examine the association between the formation of coronary artery and carotid artery atherosclerosis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. 124 patients with type 2 diabetes (64 males and 60 females with the age group 25-78 years) are considered for the research studies who have registered themselves in the Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism from April 2017 to February 2019. All participants have reported their clinical information regarding diabetes, alcohol consumption, smoking status, and medication. The blood samples from subjects are collected for measurement of HbA<sub>1c</sub>, total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-c, and LDL-c levels. Two-dimensional ultrasound has been used to measure the inner diameter, peak flow velocity, blood flow, and spectral width of the femoral artery, pop artery, anterior iliac artery, posterior tibial artery, and dorsal artery and to calculate the artery stenosis degree. Independent factors of atherosclerosis are determined by multivariate logistic regression analysis. The results are evaluated within the control group and it is found that there is no significant impact of gender, age, and body mass index (<i>P</i> > 0.05) on the lower extremity vascular diseases. Those with smoking, alcohol consumption, hypertension, and dyslipidemia have higher positive rate (<i>P</i> < 0.05). The type 2 diabetes mellitus group has higher diastolic blood pressure and lower triglyceride (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Diastolic blood pressure, HbA<sub>1C</sub>, total cholesterol, HDL-c, and LDL-C are not remarkably dissimilar between the type 2 diabetes mellitus group and the control group (<i>P</i> > 0.05). Compared with the control group, the type 2 diabetes mellitus group has higher frequency of lower extremity vascular diseases in the dorsal artery than in the pop artery (<i>P</i> < 0.05). The blood flow of type 2 diabetes mellitus group is found to be lower than that of the control group, especially in the dorsal artery (<i>P</i> < 0.05). The blood flow velocity of the dorsal artery is accelerated (<i>P</i> < 0.01). Among 117 patients of type 2 diabetes mellitus (94.35%) with a certain degree of injury, there are 72 cases of type I carotid stenosis (58.06%), 30 cases of type II carotid stenosis (24.19%), and 15 cases of type III carotid stenosis (12.10%). Out of 108 subjects in the control group, there are 84 cases of type 0 carotid stenosis (77.78%), 19 cases of type I carotid stenosis (17.59%), 5 cases of type II carotid stenosis (4.63%), and 0 case of type III carotid stenosis (0.00%). Compared with the control group, carotid stenosis is more common in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Age, smoking, duration of diseases, systolic blood pressure, and degree of carotid stenosis are found to be associated with atherosclerosis. The findings suggest that the color Doppler ultrasonography can give early warning when applied in patients with carotid and lower extremity vascular diseases to delay the incidence of diabetic macroangiopathy and to control the development of cerebral infarction, thus providing an important basis for clinical diagnosis and treatment."

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a heterogeneous situation that is accompanied with not only defective insulin secretion but also peripheral insulin resistance. β-cells are the primary organ for insulin secretion hence, it is crucial to maintain a significant β-cell mass in response to a variety of changes. Insulin resistance is a chief cause of T2DM leading to increased free fatty acid (FFA) levels which in turn elevates β-cell mass and insulin secretion as a compensation for insulin insensitivity. Recently, it has been established that amplified numbers of innate immune cells, cytokines, and chemokines result in detrimental effects on islets in such chronic conditions. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is the lymphokine that results in the prevention of arbitrary migration of macrophages and assembles macrophages at inflammatory loci. Inflammation is known to trigger monocytes in differentiating into macrophages. Progress of complications associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus, as indicated through recent findings, is also dependent on the buildup of macrophages in tissues vulnerable to diabetic injury. The present article scientifically evaluates the present knowledge concerning the mechanisms of recruitment of monocyte and macrophage-mediated injury in complications associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus. It also gives a description of some of the established and experimental therapies that might bring about a reduction in these inflammatory complications.

Among the numerous complications of diabetes, there is increasing concern over the coexisting heart failure. Metformin is the most frequently used oral antidiabetic drug that is considered to be safe and effective in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Since the publication of the UK Prospective Diabetes Study, it has been suggested that metformin might improve cardiovascular prognoses. Results from available studies have shown that metformin therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart failure was associated with improved clinical outcomes when compared with other oral antidiabetic agents, insulin, or lifestyle management. However, there have been no randomized controlled trials evaluating the influence of metformin use on clinical outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart failure. New evidence from large cardiovascular outcome trials that showed a reduction in heart failure hospitalization for SGLT2 inhibitors caused changes in recommendations on the management of hyperglycaemia. Currently, the European Society of Cardiology recommends sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart failure or at high risk for heart failure, as a first choice in drug naïve patients, or as a second drug if the patient is already on metformin. The aim of our study is to review the current state of knowledge about the position of metformin in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart failure."

The aim of this study was to establish and validate an easy-to-use nomogram that predicts the severity of LVDD in patients with T2DM. This is a retrospective study of 84 consecutive subjects with T2DM admitted to the Endocrinology Department, the First People's Hospital of Zunyi City between January 2015 and October 2020. Several echocardiographic characteristics were used to diagnose diastolic dysfunction according to the 2016 diastolic dysfunction ASE guidelines. Anthropometric, demographic, and biochemical parameters were collected. Through a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model, we reduced the dimensionality of the data and determined factors for the nomogram. The mean follow-up was 25.97 months. Cases were divided into two groups, those with LVDD (31) and those without (53). LASSO regression identified total cholesterol (Tol.chol), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), right ventricular anterior wall (RVAW) and epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) were identified as predictive factors in the nomogram. The ROC curve analysis demonstrated that the AUC value for most clinical paramerters was higher than 0.6. The nomogram can be used to promote the individualized prediction of LVDD risk in T2DM patients, and help to prioritize patients diagnosed with echocardiography."

This review systematically assessed the existing literature on economic evaluation of health behavior interventions to prevent and manage type 2 diabetes mellitus for people living in Asian countries. Eligible studies were identified through a search of six bibliographic databases, namely, PubMed, Scopus, Public Health Database by ProQuest, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature Complete, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. Randomized controlled trials of health behavior interventions and studies published in the English language from January 2000 to May 2022 were included in the review. The search yielded 3867 records, of which 11 studies were included in the review. All included studies concluded that health behavior interventions were cost-effective. Eight of these studies undertook an evaluation from a health system perspective, two studies used both societal and health system perspectives, and one study utilized a societal and multi-payer perspective. This review identified the time horizon, direct and indirect medical costs, and discount rates as the most important considerations in determining cost effectiveness. These findings have implications in extending health behavior interventions to prevent and manage type 2 diabetes mellitus in low-resource settings, and are likely to yield the most promising outcomes for people with type 2 diabetes mellitus."

This receptor mediates a multitude of functions in the body including release of incretins, secretion of insulin as well as sensation of pain. Since FFAR1 causes secretion of insulin and regulates glucose metabolism, efforts were made to unfold its structure followed by discovering agonists for the receptor and the utilization of these agonists in the therapy of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Development of such functional FFAR1 agonists is a necessity because the currently available therapy for type 2 diabetes mellitus has numerous drawbacks, of which, the major one is hypoglycemia. Since the most prominent effect of the FFAR1 agonists is on glucose concentration in the body, so the major research is focused on treating type 2 diabetes mellitus, though the agonists could benefit other metabolic disorders and neurological disorders as well. The agonists developed so far had one major limitation, i.e., hepatotoxicity. Although, the only agonist that could reach phase 3 clinical trials was TAK-875 developed by Takeda Pharmaceuticals but it was also withdrawn due to toxic effects on the liver. Thus, there are numerous agonists for the varied binding sites of the receptor but no drug available yet. There does seem to be a ray of hope in the drugs that target FFAR1 but a lot more efforts towards drug discovery would result in the successful management of type 2 diabetes mellitus."

An imbalance in the gut microbiota and metabolites can disrupt the function of the intestinal barrier, cause changes in the permeability of the intestinal mucosa and promote the immune inflammatory response, thereby aggravating the fluctuation of blood glucose level and promoting the occurrence and development of the chronic complications of DM. Manipulating the GM and metabolites is a promising therapeutic intervention and is being studied extensively. Shenqi compound (SQC) is a traditional Chinese medicine formulation, which has been widely used to improve T2DM. Studies have demonstrated that SQC can reduce glycemic variability, alleviate the inflammatory response, etc. However, its underlying mechanism remains unknown. Therefore, in this experiment, We administered SQC to Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats and evaluated its effect on blood glucose homeostasis and the intestinal mucosal barrier. We identified the profiles of the GM and metabolites with the aid of 16S rDNA gene sequencing and non-target metabolomics analysis. It showed that SQC intervention could reduce glycemic variability, regulate serum levels of glucagon and insulin, and improve injury to the intestinal mucosal barrier of GK rats. In the gut, the ratio of bacteria of the phyla Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes could be improved after SQC intervention. SQC also regulated the relative abundance of Prevotellaceae, Butyricimonas, Bacteroides, Blautia, Roseburia, Lactobacillus, and Rothia. We found out that expression of 40 metabolites was significantly improved after SQC intervention. Further analyses of metabolic pathways indicated that the therapeutic effect of SQC might be related predominantly to its ability to improve gluconeogenesis/glycolysis, amino acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, citrate cycle, and butanoate metabolism. These results suggest that SQC may exert a beneficial role in T2DM by modulating the GM and metabolites in different pathways."

Compared with GLP-1 treatment, probiotic treatment can directly regulate homeostasis of the host gut microbe, and thus homeostasis of its metabolites. Currently, the regulatory role of probiotics on intestinal metabolites after treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the therapeutic effect of probiotics on type 2 diabetes mellitus and its regulatory effect on short-chain fatty acids, which are metabolites of intestinal microorganisms. I collected feces from 15 patients with diabetes before treatment and 15 patients with type 2 diabetes after treatment with GLP-1 and probiotics. The abundance of short-chain fatty acids in feces was determined by GC-MS. Results Both GLP-1 and probiotics could improve the levels of blood glucose, urine glucose and BMI in patients with type 2 diabetes. After glP-1 treatment, two short-chain fatty acids (butyric acid and valerate acid) in intestine were significantly changed. Propionic acid and isovalerate were significantly changed after probiotic treatment. At the same time, KEGG signal pathway enrichment results showed that probiotics intervention mainly achieved the purpose of treating type 2 diabetes through regulating protein and carbohydrate metabolism. Taken together, our study shows changes in intestinal short-chain fatty acids after probiotics or GLP-1 treatment of type 2 diabetes, which will provide us with new insights into the mechanism of probiotics treatment of type 2 diabetes, as well as potential intervention targets for diabetes treatment."

Objective: the objective of our study was to evaluate the influence of this resistin gene SNP (rs10401670) on the serum levels of resistin, as well as on the presence of type-2 diabetes mellitus in obese subjects and on insulin resistance. Material and methods: a Caucasian population of 653 obese subjects was analyzed. All subjects underwent an anthropometric evaluation (weight, waist circumference, fat mass), an evaluation of their nutritional intake, a biochemical profile (glucose, insulin, C-reactive protein, lipid profile, insulin, HOMA-IR), and an assessment of the rs10401670 genotype. Determinations were made in the presence of type-2 diabetes mellitus (DM2). A univariate analysis was carried out and a logistic regression was performed with a dichotomy parameter (DM2: yes/no) (SPSS, 17.0, IL, EUA). Results: genotype distribution was as follows: CC, 212 subjects (32.4%); CT, 340 subjects (52.0%); and TT, 101 subjects (15.6%). There were no significant differences between both genotypes in lipid profile, basal glucose, C-reactive protein, anthropometric parameters, nutritional intake, and blood pressure levels.

Methods and Results In a population-based cohort of 15 010 individuals from the GHS (Gutenberg Health Study) (aged 35-74 years at enrollment in 2007-2012), we identified 1610 cases of incident pre-diabetes mellitus and 386 cases of incident type 2 diabetes mellitus by hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub> (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) and/or medical history between 2012 and 2017. Endothelial function of conductance and resistance vessels was measured by flow-mediated dilation and digital volume plethysmography-derived reactive hyperemia index, respectively. Multivariable regression modeling was used to estimate β coefficients of HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels at follow-up and relative risks of incident (pre-)diabetes mellitus. Reactive hyperemia index was independently associated with HbA<sub>1c</sub> after multivariable adjustment for baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub>, sex, age, socioeconomic status, arterial hypertension, waist/height ratio, pack-years of smoking, non-high-density lipoprotein/high-density lipoprotein ratio, physical activity, family history of myocardial infarction/stroke, prevalent cardiovascular disease, medication use, and C-reactive protein (β=-0.020; <i>P</i>=0.0029). The adjusted relative risk per SD decline in reactive hyperemia index was 1.08 (95% CI, 1.02-1.15; <i>P</i>=0.012) for incident pre-diabetes mellitus and 1.16 (95% CI, 1.01-1.34; <i>P</i>=0.041) for incident type 2 diabetes mellitus.

This association remained significant after additional adjustment for interval development of coronary artery disease (hazard ratio, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.64-3.57). The hazard ratios for HF by type of MVD were 2.22 (95% CI, 1.51-3.27), 1.30 (95% CI, 0.72-2.36), and 1.33 (95% CI, 0.86-2.07) for nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy, respectively. CONCLUSIONS MVD is associated with an excess HF risk in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus after adjusting for other known risk factors. Our findings underscore the contribution of MVD to the development of diabetes mellitus-related HF. REGISTRATION: URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT00017953."

The SIMPLE trial (The Effects of Empagliflozin on Myocardial Flow Reserve in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus) investigated the effects of empagliflozin on myocardial flow reserve (MFR) reflecting microvascular perfusion, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus at high cardiovascular disease risk. Methods and Results We randomized 90 patients to either empagliflozin 25 mg once daily or placebo for 13 weeks, as add-on to standard therapy. The primary outcome was change in MFR at week 13, quantified by Rubidium-82 positron emission tomography/computed tomography. The secondary key outcomes were changes in resting rate-pressure product adjusted MFR, changes to myocardial flow during rest and stress, and reversible cardiac ischemia. Mean baseline MFR was 2.21 (95% CI, 2.08-2.35). There was no change from baseline in MFR at week 13 in either the empagliflozin: 0.01 (95% CI, -0.18 to 0.21) or placebo groups: 0.06 (95% CI, -0.15 to 0.27), with no treatment effect -0.05 (95% CI, -0.33 to 0.23). No effects on the secondary outcome parameters by Rubidium-82 positron emission tomography/computed tomography was observed. Treatment with empagliflozin reduced hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub> by 0.76% (95% CI, 1.0-0.5; <i>P</i><0.001) and increased hematocrit by 1.69% (95% CI, 0.7-2.6; <i>P</i><0.001). Conclusions Empagliflozin did not improve MFR among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and high cardiovascular disease risk.

At least one coronary non-target lesion was recorded at the first procedure in these patients. Patients were grouped according to the diagnose of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Demographic features, risk factors of coronary heart disease, laboratory results as well as characteristics of coronary non-target lesions were collected at baseline (first coronary angiography) and follow-up (second coronary angiography). Lesion progression was defined by quantitative coronary angiography analysis. Lesions revascularization was recorded. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to define the impacts of diabetes mellitus on progression and revascularization of non-target lesions. Subgroup analysis in diabetic and non-diabetic groups were further performed. Receiver operating characteristics curve was used to identify the predictive value of HbA1c. <b>Results:</b> A total of 1 255 patients were included, and 1 003(79.9%) were male, age was(58.0±9.7) years old. And 486 patients were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Follow-up time was (14.8±4.5) months. Compared with non-diabetic group, diabetic group were older with less male and had higher BMI index as well as higher prevalence of hypertension, dyslipidemia, prior myocardial infarction and prior percutaneous coronary intervention(all <i>P<</i>0.05). Diabetic patients also had higher level of white blood cells, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, endothelin and HbA1c at both baseline and follow-up compared with non-diabetic patients (all <i>P<</i>0.01). There was no significant difference on progression of non-target lesions (20.0%(97/486) vs. 18.5%(142/769), <i>P=</i>0.512), revascularization of non-target lesions (13.2%(64/486) vs. 15.9%(122/769), <i>P=</i>0.190) and non-target lesion related myocardial infarction(1.9%(9/486) vs. 1.3%(10/769), <i>P=</i>0.436) between diabetic and non-diabetic patients. Multivariable Cox regression analysis revealed that diabetes mellitus was not an independent predictor for progression and revascularization of non-target lesions (Both <i>P></i>0.05). Subgroup analysis in diabetic patients showed that baseline HbA1c level(<i>HR</i>=1.160, 95<i>%CI</i> 1.009-1.333, <i>P=</i>0.037) was an independent predictor for non-target lesion progression. Cut-off value of HbA1c was 6.5% (Area Under Curve(AUC) 0.57, specificity 88.7%; sensitivity 24.2%, <i>P=</i>0.046) by receiver operating characteristics curve. Patients with HbA1c level above 6.5% had 2.8 times higher risk of lesion progression compared with patients with HbA1c level below 6.5% (<i>HR</i>=2.838, 95<i>%CI</i> 1.505-5.349, <i>P=</i>0.001).

Engagement in regular physical activity has been shown to significantly attenuate non-communicable diseases including type-2 diabetes. However, the overall rate of physical inactivity among Saudi Arabian adults is currently 80.5%, owing to time pressures, high-density traffic, poor air quality, lack of suitable exercise places/sports facilities, lack of social/friends support, gender, cultural barriers, low self-confidence, lack of time and environmental factors. Previous analyses have shown that home-based activity interventions can be effective. Therefore, given the aforementioned barriers to physical activity in Saudi Arabia; a home-based physical activity may be an ideal solution in type-2 diabetic patients. This manuscript describes the study protocol for a randomized control trial, examining the effects of a home-based physical activity intervention in Saudi Arabian adults with type-2 diabetes. The study will recruit 62 individuals with type-2 diabetes from the Jazan region of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, who will be individually randomized to either a physical activity or control group. This 24-week investigation will involve 12-weeks of physical activity in the physical activity group and feature three examination points i.e., baseline, 12-weeks and 24-weeks (follow-up). The primary study outcome is the between-group difference in blood HbA1c levels relative to controls. Secondary outcomes measures will be between-group differences in anthropometric, blood lipid, physical fitness, and patient-reported quality of life outcomes pertinent to type-2 diabetes. Statistical analysis will be conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. The trial has been granted ethical approval by Jazan University, Health Research Ethics Committee (REF: 2177) and formally registered as a trial (NCT04937296).

The formation of AGEs may activate receptors for advanced glycation end products which induce intracellular signaling, ultimately enhancing oxidative stress, a well-known contributor to type 2 diabetes mellitus. In addition, AGEs are possible therapeutic targets for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus and its complications. This review article highlights the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antidiabetic properties of the <i>Nymphaea</i> species, and the screening of such aquatic plants for antiglycation activity may provide a safer alternative to the adverse effects related to glucotoxicity. Since oxidation and glycation are relatively similar to each other, therefore, there is a possibility that the <i>Nymphaea</i> species may also have antiglycating properties because of its powerful antioxidant properties. Herbal products and their derivatives are the preeminent resources showing prominent medicinal properties for most of the chronic diseases including type 2 diabetes mellitus. Among these, the <i>Nymphaea</i> species has also shown elevated activity in scavenging free radicals. This species has a load of phytochemical constituents which shows various therapeutic and nutritional value including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant profiles. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first article highlighting the possibility of an antiglycation value of the <i>Nymphaea</i> species by inhibiting AGEs in mediation of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

The meal tolerance test (MTT) is simple to administer physiological insulin-stimulating test. Previous studies have reported that several CPR-related indices are useful markers for predicting insulin requirement in type 2 diabetes. In the present study, we investigated the serum CPR response during the MTT in hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in order to clarify the clinical utility of the MTT. Methods We performed the MTT using a test meal with timed measurements of the serum CPR level based on the oral glucose tolerance test over 180 minutes and tested the correlation of various CPR-related indices and clinical factors in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Patients The subjects were patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who had been admitted to our hospital for diabetes management and education. The final study population consisted of 68 patients. Results The fasting CPR level was correlated with the 24-hour urinary CPR excretion and body mass index. The serum CPR level at 120 minutes in the MTT was strongly correlated with the area under the curve of CPR during the MTT. The patients who needed insulin therapy at 6 months after hospitalization showed a significant lower incremental CPR value from 0 to 120 minutes in the MTT than those who did not need insulin therapy. Conclusion The plasma C-peptide levels at 0 and 120 minutes in the MTT provide essential information for the clinical management of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus."

In a large population-based sample we investigated: (a) the association between socioeconomic position defined by level of education and the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus by self-report in the Faroe Islands; and (b) to what degree lifestyle factors mediate the association. <i>Methods:</i> We used cross-sectional data from the population-based Public Health Survey Faroes 2015 (<i>n</i>=1095). We present odds ratios for type 2 diabetes mellitus by socioeconomic position from logistic regression models. In our main model we adjusted for potential confounders and in a secondary model we additionally adjusted for potential mediating lifestyle factors. <i>Results:</i> Individuals with middle and low levels of education display higher odds ratios of type 2 diabetes mellitus of 2.80 (95% confidence interval 1.32-5.92) and 4.65 (95% confidence interval 1.93-11.17) in adjusted analysis, respectively, compared to their counterparts with high education. After adjustment for potentially mediating lifestyle factors the estimates were attenuated slightly, but a significant statistical association remained, with lifestyle-related mediating factors in total explaining 21% for middle education and 34% for low education participants. <b><i>Conclusions</i>: Our results demonstrate that there may be a social gradient in the distribution of type 2 diabetes mellitus in the Faroe Islands, and that the association is partly mediated by lifestyle factors.</b>"

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists have neuroprotective effects in experimental studies. We aimed to assess the effect of liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, on cognitive function and whether its effect was associated with metabolic changes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Methods and Results Fifty patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were recruited in this prospective study. All patients underwent cognitive assessment and brain activation monitoring by functional near-infrared spectroscopy. At 12 weeks, patients in the glucagon-like peptide-1 group acquired better scores in all cognitive tests and showed remarkable improvement in memory and attention (<i>P</i>=0.040) test compared with the control group after multivariable adjustment. Compared with the control group, liraglutide significantly increased activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and orbitofrontal cortex brain regions (<i>P</i>=0.0038). After liraglutide treatment, cognitive scores were significantly correlated with changes in these activating brain regions (<i>P</i><0.05), but no correlation was observed between the changes in cognitive function and changes of body mass index, blood pressure, and glycemic levels. Conclusions We concluded that liraglutide improves cognitive decline in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. This beneficial effect is independent of its hypoglycemic effect and weight loss. The optimal intervention should be targeted to cognitive decline in the early stages of dementia. Registration URL: https://www.ClinicalTrials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT03707171."

Similarly, the pressor and the cardioaccelerator responses to tendon stretch were significantly greater in the 31-wk T2DM rats [∆MAP = 69 ± 6 mmHg; change in heart rate (∆HR) = 28 ± 4 beats/min] compared with nondiabetic rats (∆MAP = 14 ± 2 mmHg; ∆HR = 5 ± 3 beats/min; <i>P</i> < 0.05). These findings suggest that the exercise pressor reflex changes as T2DM progresses and that a sensitized mechanoreflex may play a role in exaggerating these cardiovascular responses.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> This is the first study to provide evidence that as type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) progresses, the exercise pressor reflex becomes exaggerated, an effect that may be due to a sensitized mechanoreflex. Moreover, these findings provide compelling evidence suggesting that impairments in the reflexive control of circulation contribute to exaggerated blood pressure responses to exercise in T2DM."

36131931,The bidirectional biological interplay between microbiome and viruses in periodontitis and type-2 diabetes mellitus.,['bacterial metabolites'],"['Boyu Tang', 'Caixia Yan', 'Xin Shen', 'Yan Li']","Periodontitis was an inflammatory disease associated with a dysbiosis of the oral flora characterized by a chronic sustained inflammation inducing the resorption of alveolar bone and leading to tooth loss. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) was a metabolic disease caused by impaired insulin action. The oral microbiome played a crucial role in modulating both the innate and adaptive immune system during the trigger and exacerbation of periodontitis and T2D. The bidirectional relationship of T2D and periodontitis had been the focus of intensive research, but those were not well explored. In this commentary, an in-depth analysis of the changes of microbiome and bacterial metabolites in periodontitis with or without diabetes was described. The promotion of periodontitis to T2D might involve inflammatory factors/receptors, oxidative stress, microRNA and so on. The effect of diabetes on periodontitis might involve adipose factor pathway, AGE/RAGE and RANK/RANKL pathway etc. Generally, periodontitis and diabetes are closely related to the microecological-epithelial interaction, soft tissue degradation, bone coupling disorder, immune regulation and gene transcription. The viruses, including HBV, HCV, HSV-1, Coronavirus, HCMV, EBV, HIV, phageome and so on, played an important role in the development of T2D and periodontitis. An in-depth understanding of the relationship between microbiome and host was of great significance to clarify the bidirectional mechanisms, suggesting that the periodontitis or T2D remission will have a positive impact on the other."

Individuals with diabetes mellitus are more likely to develop hearing loss, tinnitus, and dizziness due to macro- and microvascular complications. The extent to which auditory and vestibular functions are impaired in individuals with type-2 diabetes mellitus is still under debate. <b>Objective</b>  To systematically review studies focusing on auditory and vestibular functions in individuals with type-2 diabetes mellitus. <b>Data Synthesis</b>  A search was conducted in the PubMed, MedlinePlus, Ingenta Connect and Google Scholar databases for articles published until June 2019. A total of 15,980 articles were primarily retrieved, 33 of which were shortlisted based on the inclusion criteria set by the investigators for the systematic review. Out of 33 full-length articles, 26 evaluated the functioning of the auditory system, while 7 evaluated the functioning of the vestibular system. Most studies related to auditory functioning reported a significant effect of type-2 diabetes mellitus on the peripheral auditory system, whereas studies on vestibular functioning reported no significant effect of diabetes mellitus on the functioning of the peripheral vestibular end-organ. <b>Conclusion</b>  Overall, the results of various audiological and peripheral vestibular tests reveal distinctive peripheral and/or central auditory and vestibular end-organ impairments in individuals with type-2 diabetes mellitus."

These medications target the SGLT2 transporter in the proximal convoluted tubule to prevent reabsorption of filtered glucose, resulting in glucosuria. Other clinically meaningful benefits beyond glycemic control include reductions in blood pressure, weight, and albuminuria. Three large clinical trials and subsequent meta-analyses studying SGLT2 inhibitors demonstrated significant cardiovascular benefits including reductions in heart failure hospitalizations, as well as reduced risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death in patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. In addition, these agents produced kidney benefits including significant reductions in worsening estimated glomerular filtration rate, progression to end-stage kidney disease, and progression of chronic kidney disease in patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus and albuminuric chronic kidney disease. However, despite these beneficial cardiovascular and kidney effects, numerous reports of acute kidney injury, including need for dialysis and death, have been reported to the FDA adverse events reporting system raising concern among providers and a warning announcement from the FDA.

Based on high-level and high-quality evidence, qualitative and quantitative analysis of the prescribing decisions of physicians is beneficial to improving clinical efficacy. A mature methodological system is available for the retrieval, analysis, summary, evaluation, and recommendation of the evidence, but there are still few studies on physicians' prescribing decisions. How to analyze the trend of physicians' prescribing decisions based on the priority ranking in addition and subtraction of prescriptions? Analytic hierarchy process(AHP) is a method for decision making, which arranges the elements of the decision problem into overall goal, criteria, and operational sub-criteria, and uses the matrix eigenvector method to solve the problem. This study aims to analyze the priority of physicians' prescribing decisions for diabetes mellitus with deficiency of both Qi and Yin based on AHP. To be specific, a database of diabetes mellitus cases with deficiency of both Qi and Yin was established and AHP was used to yield the priority ranking of Chinese patent medicine prescriptions in specific clinical scenarios. In the selected cases of diabetes mellitus with deficiency of both Qi and Yin, Xiaoke Pills was the best prescription for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus(deficiency of both Qi and Yin)(normalized=0.388), followed by Liuwei Dihuang Pills(normalized=0.269), Qishen Capsules(normalized=0.230), and Shengmai Injection(normalized=0.113). According to the analysis the available data, for type 2 diabetes mellitus(deficiency of both Qi and Yin), Xiaoke Pills was the most effective prescription in specific scenarios.

In addition, the effects of ellagic acid (EA) on SCH C57BL/6J and db/db mice were also investigated to explore potential therapeutic drug against SCH-induced abnormal glucose metabolism. T2DM patients were recruited in our study and categorized into two groups according to thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) value: T2DM without SCH group (TSH ≤4 μIU/ml; n = 30) and T2DM with SCH group (TSH >4μIU/ml; n = 60). Methimazole (MMI; 0.08 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>  day<sup>-1</sup> ) was intragastrically administrated for 12 weeks to establish SCH in C57BL/6J and db/db mice. Compared with T2DM patients without SCH, poor glycemic and cholesterol control were emerged in T2DM patients with SCH and that were prominent in patients with TSH more than 10 μIU/ml. In addition, a significant positive correlation between serum TSH and fasting plasma-glucose (FPG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), or glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was observed in T2DM patients with SCH. Moreover, abnormal glucose metabolism in C57BL/6J and db/db mice with SCH has been attenuated by EA administration. Our findings provided data regarding the positive correlation between high TSH level with poor glycemic control in T2DM patients with SCH. EA might be a supportive strategy for preventing SCH-induced abnormal glucose metabolism. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) is a potential risk factor associated with abnormal glucose metabolism in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A clinical theory of a positive correlation between high TSH level and poor glycemic control was validated in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients and mouse models. Ellagic acid (EA) might be a supportive strategy for preventing SCH-induced abnormal glucose metabolism that provided a treatment option in T2DM patients with subclinical hypothyroidism in clinical practice."

Genetic mutations, obesity and lack of physical activity constitute the possible factors that can lead to onset and progression of this disorder. However, there is another major factor that can be the root cause of type 2 diabetes mellitus and that is an imbalance in the microorganisms that inhabit the gut. The gut microbiome is a vital component that needs to be given significant attention because any ""dysbiosis"" in the colonic microorganisms can transform the host from a state of health to a state of disease. This transformation is quite obvious since the gut barrier integrity, host metabolism such as sensitivity to insulin and maintaining blood glucose level are carried out by the tiny organisms inhabiting our intestine. In fact, the normal functioning of the human body is accredited to the microbes, particularly the bacteria, because they generate their metabolites that communicate with host cells and maintain normal physiology. Giving importance to gut health is, therefore, necessary to prevent metabolic diseases that can be maintained by the intake of prebiotics, probiotics, synbiotics along with healthy diet. The tiny microorganisms in the gut that keep our body free of disorders such as type 2 diabetes mellitus need to be in a state of 'eubiosis', else the consequences of disturbance in gut microbes can progress to serious complications in the host."

Liver ultrasound examination and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) were used to examine the body composition. Patients were grouped according to gender and whether or not they had combined NAFLD, and indicators such as age, duration of diabetes, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, biochemical indicators, skeletal muscle mass index (SMI), prevalence of sarcopenia, and medication status were collected. An independent-sample t-test, two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test or <i>χ</i> (2) test were performed on the data. Logistic regression model was used to analyze the correlation between NAFLD, sarcopenia and SMI in diabetic patients of different genders. <b>Results:</b> The average age of 792 cases were (64.54 ± 9.61) years, and there were 301 (38%) patients with NAFLD. The prevalence of sarcopenia in male and female NAFLD patients was significantly higher than non-NAFLD patients (male 20.2% and 9.9%, χ(2) = 9.67, <i>P</i> = 0.002; female 12.2% and 5.1%, χ(2) = 5.64, <i>P</i> = 0.018).

It can lead to serious long-term complications and produces significant costs. Due to the chronicle character of the disease, it requires continuous medical treatment and good therapy adherence of those suffering. Therefore, diabetes self-management education (DSME) (and support DSMES) plays a significant role to increase patient's self-management capacity and improve diabetes therapy. Research indicates that these outcomes might be difficult to maintain. Consequently, effective strategies to preserve the positive effects of DSMES are needed. Preliminary results show that peer support, which means support from a person who has experiential knowledge of a specific behavior or stressor and similar characteristics as the target population, is associated with better outcomes in terms of HbA<sub>1c</sub>, cardiovascular disease risk factors or self-efficacy at a lower cost compared to standard therapy. Peer-supported instant messaging services (IMS) approaches have significant potential for diabetes management because support can be provided easily and prompt, is inexpensive, and needs less effort to attend compared to standard therapy. The major objective of the study is to analyze the impact of a peer-supported IMS intervention in addition to a standard diabetes therapy on the glycemic control of type 2 diabetic patients."

Autophagy is a key regulator in metabolic homeostasis such as lipid metabolism, energy management and the balance of cellular mineral substances. Mitophagy is selective autophagy for clearing the damaged mitochondria and dysfunctional mitochondria. A myriad of evidence has demonstrated a major role of mitophagy in the regulation of type 2 diabetes and metabolic homeostasis. It is well established that defective mitophagy has been linked to the development of insulin resistance. Moreover, insulin resistance is further progressed to various diseases such as nephropathy, retinopathy and cardiovascular diseases. Concordantly, restoration of mitophagy will be a reliable and therapeutic target for type 2 diabetes. Recently, various phytochemicals have been proved to prevent dysfunctions of β-cells by mitophagy inductions during diabetes developments. In agreement with the above phenomenon, mitophagy inducers should be warranted as potential and novel therapeutic agents for treating diabetes. This review focuses on the role of mitophagy in type 2 diabetes relevant diseases and the pharmacological basis and therapeutic potential of autophagy regulators in type 2 diabetes."

The individual-level risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events in primary prevention populations with type 2 diabetes mellitus is highly heterogeneous. Accurate risk stratification in this group is paramount to optimize the use of preventive therapies. Herein, we review the use of the coronary artery calcium score as a decision aid in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus without clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease to guide the use of preventive pharmacotherapies, such as aspirin, lipid-lowering mediations, and cardiometabolic agents. The magnitude of expected risk reduction for each of these therapies must be weighed against its cost and potential adverse events. Coronary artery calcium has the potential to improve risk stratification in select individuals beyond clinical and laboratory risk factors, thus providing a more granular assessment of the expected net benefit with each therapy. In patients with diabetes mellitus and stable chest pain, coronary computed tomography angiography increases the sensitivity for coronary artery disease diagnoses compared with functional studies because of the detection of nonobstructive atherosclerosis. Most importantly, this anatomic approach may improve cardiovascular outcomes by increasing the use of evidence-based preventive therapies informed by plaque burden. We therefore provide an updated discussion of the pivotal role of coronary computed tomography angiography in the workup of stable chest pain in patients with diabetes mellitus in the context of recent landmark trials, such as PROMISE trial (Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain), SCOT-HEART trial (Scottish Computed Tomography of the Heart), and ISCHEMIA trial (International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness with Medical and Invasive Approaches).

Charcot arthropathy is a severe and challenging complication leading to bone destruction and mutilating bone deformities. Wnt signaling is involved in increasing bone mineral density, bone homeostasis and apoptotic processes. It has been shown that type 2 diabetes mellitus is strongly associated with gene variants of the Wnt signaling pathway, specifically polymorphisms of TCF7L2 (transcription factor 7 like 2), which is an effector transcription factor of this pathway."

This study aimed to investigate the nexus between workplace exposure for wood, welding, motor mechanic, and oil refinery workers and the prevalence of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Initially, 2500 male volunteers who were wood, welding, motor mechanic, and oil refinery workers were interviewed. After an examination of their demographics and medical history, 1408 non-smoking wood (158), welding (560), motor mechanic (272), and oil refinery workers (217), along with 201 control subjects, were selected. The participants' mean age was 36.59 ± 0.29 years and the mean body mass index was 26.14 ± 0.11 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. The selected industry workers had been exposed to their respective wood, welding, motor mechanic, and oil refinery workplaces for 8 h per day, six days per week. The American Diabetic Association (ADA)-based glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) criterion was used to diagnose prediabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Subjects with an HbA1c of less than 5.7% were regarded as non-diabetics, subjects with an HbA1c of 5.7%-6.4% were considered prediabetics, and subjects with an HbA1c of more than 6.4% were considered diabetics. In wood industry workers, the prevalence of prediabetes (PD) was 64 (40.50%) and in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), it was 21 (13.29%); in welding workers, the prevalence of prediabetes was 261 (46.60%), and for T2DM, it was 90 (16.07%); in motor mechanic workers, the prevalence of prediabetes was 110 (40.44%), and for T2DM, it was 126 (46.32%); and in oil refinery workers, the prevalence of prediabetes was 80 (36.86%), and for T2DM, it was 35 (16.12%). However; the combined prevalence of prediabetes and T2DM among wood, welding, motor mechanic, and oil refinery workers was 421 (34.79%) and 515 (42.66%), respectively. The prevalence of prediabetes and T2DM among workers increased with the duration of working exposure in the wood, welding, motor mechanic, and oil refinery industries. A one-year working exposure in these industries caused an increase of 0.03% in HbA1c. Workplace exposure in wood, welding, motor mechanic, and oil refinery industries increased the risk of prevalence of prediabetes and T2DM among the workers and affected the diabetes etiology."

Limited efficacy of current therapies has prompted a search for novel therapeutic options. Here we show that treatment of pre-diabetic mice with mitochondrially targeted tamoxifen, a potential anti-cancer agent with senolytic activity, improves glucose tolerance and reduces body weight with most pronounced reduction of visceral adipose tissue due to reduced food intake, suppressed adipogenesis and elimination of senescent cells. Glucose-lowering effect of mitochondrially targeted tamoxifen is linked to improvement of type 2 diabetes mellitus-related hormones profile and is accompanied by reduced lipid accumulation in liver. Lower senescent cell burden in various tissues, as well as its inhibitory effect on pre-adipocyte differentiation, results in lower level of circulating inflammatory mediators that typically enhance metabolic dysfunction. Targeting senescence with mitochodrially targeted tamoxifen thus represents an approach to the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus and its related comorbidities, promising a complex impact on senescence-related pathologies in aging population of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with potential translation into the clinic."

A dose-response relationship was estimated by using generalized least squares trend regression. Finally, twelve cohort studies and nine cross-sectional studies were included (inter-rater agreement, k = 0.96). The result of meta-analysis indicated that shift work was associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes (relative risk = 1.10, 95% confidence interval = 1.05-1.14). Subgroup analyses demonstrated that female shift workers have increased risk of type 2 diabetes while male not observed, health care workers showed the highest risk compared with civil servants and manual workers, and night shift and rotating shift were associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Dose-response meta-analysis based on three cohorts among female workers indicated that there might be a positive association between duration of shift work and the risk of type 2 diabetes. In conclusion, shift work is positively associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Among female workers, with the years of exposure to shift work prolonged, the risk of type 2 diabetes might increase accordingly.

Methods: We used Linkage-Disequilibrium Adjusted Kinships (LDAK) and LDAK-Thin models to calculate the relative heritability of each variant and compare the relative heritability for each phenotype. Biological analysis was carried out for the phenotype whose variants made a significant contribution. Potential hub genes were prioritized based on topological parameters of the protein-protein interaction network. We included 16 behavior-related phenotypes and 2607 valid variants. In the LDAK model, we found the variants of alcohol consumption and caffeine intake were identified as contributing higher relative heritability than that of the random variants. Compared with the relative expected heritability contributed by the variants associated with type 2 diabetes, the relative expected heritability contributed by the variants associated with these two phenotypes was higher. In the LDAK-Thin model, the relative heritability of variants of 11 phenotypes was statistically higher than random variants. Biological function analysis showed the same distributions among type 2 diabetes and alcohol consumption. We eventually screened out 31 hub genes interacting intensively, four of which were validated and showed the upregulated expression pattern in blood samples seen in type 2 diabetes cases. Conclusion: We found that alcohol consumption contributed higher relative heritability. Hub genes may influence the onset of type 2 diabetes by a mediating effect or a pleiotropic effect. Our results provide new insight to reveal the role of behavior-related factors in the conundrum of ""missing heritability"" of type 2 diabetes."
31902326,Sex Differences in Cardiovascular Effectiveness of Newer Glucose-Lowering Drugs Added to Metformin in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.,['glucose‐lowering agents'],"['Valeria Raparelli', 'Malik Elharram', 'Cristiano S Moura', 'Michal Abrahamowicz', 'Sasha Bernatsky', 'Hassan Behlouli', 'Louise Pilote']","Background Randomized controlled trials showed that newer glucose-lowering agents are cardioprotective, but most participants were men. It is unknown whether benefits are similar in women. Methods and Results Among adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus not controlled with metformin with no prior use of insulin, we assessed for sex differences in the cardiovascular effectiveness and safety of sodium-glucose-like transport-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, initiated as second-line agents relative to sulfonylureas (reference-group). We studied type 2 diabetes mellitus American adults with newly dispensed sulfonylureas, SGLT-2i, GLP-1RA, or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (Marketscan-Database: 2011-2017). We used multivariable Cox proportional hazards models with time-varying exposure to compare time to first nonfatal cardiovascular event (myocardial infarction/unstable angina, stroke, and heart failure), and safety outcomes between drugs users, and tested for sex-drug interactions. Among 167 254 type 2 diabetes mellitus metformin users (46% women, median age 59 years, at low cardiovascular risk), during a median 4.5-year follow-up, cardiovascular events incidence was lower in women than men (14.7 versus 16.7 per 1000-person-year). Compared with sulfonylureas, hazard ratios (HRs) for cardiovascular events were lower with GLP-1RA (adjusted HR-women: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.48-0.68; aHR-men: 0.82, 0.71-0.95), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (aHR-women: 0.83, 0.77-0.89; aHR-men: 0.85, 0.79-0.91) and SGLT-2i (aHR-women: 0.58, 0.46-0.74; aHR-men: 0.69, 0.57-0.83). A sex-by-drug interaction was statistically significant only for GLP-1RA (<i>P</i>=0.002), suggesting greater cardiovascular effectiveness in women. Compared with sulfonylureas, risks of adverse events were similarly lower in both sexes for GLP-1RA (aHR-women: 0.81, 0.73-0.89; aHR-men: 0.80, 0.71-0.89), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (aHR-women: 0.82, 0.78-0.87; aHR-men: 0.83, 0.78-0.87) and SGLT-2i (aHR-women: 0.68, 0.59-0.78; aHR-men: 0.67, 0.59-0.78) (all sex-drug interactions for adverse events <i>P</i>>0.05). Conclusions Newer glucose-lowering drugs were associated with lower risk of cardiovascular events than sulfonylureas, with greater effectiveness of GLP-1RA in women than men. Overall, they appeared safe, with a better safety profile for SGLT-2i than for GLP-1RA regardless of sex."

However, the relationship between serum osteocalcin levels and risk of incident type 2 diabetes mellitus is not clear. The objective of this study is to investigate whether serum osteocalcin levels are associated with the risk of incident type 2 diabetes mellitus. This study included 1691 Japanese postmenopausal women, 61 incident diabetes cases, and 1630 non-diabetic control subjects in the observation period. Baseline concentrations of intact osteocalcin, HbA1c, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, adiponectin, leptin, urinary N-telopeptides were assessed. Serum osteocalcin levels were significantly correlated with HbA1c levels among 1691 Japanese postmenopausal women (R = -0.12, P < 0.0001). In receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the optimal cut-off levels for serum osteocalcin to predict the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus was 6.1 ng/mL. The group with baseline osteocalcin levels <6.1 ng/mL showed a significantly higher risk for developing diabetes than the group with baseline osteocalcin levels >6.1 ng/mL (log-rank test, P  <  0.0001) during the mean observation period (7.6 ± 6.1 years; mean ± SD). In multiple Cox proportional hazard analysis, osteocalcin levels were significantly associated with development of type 2 diabetes mellitus during the observation period. Our results indicate that a decrease in serum osteocalcin levels is associated with future development of type 2 diabetes mellitus independent of conventional risk factors in Japanese postmenopausal women."

Inflammation associated with the onset and exacerbation of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is an essential factor in the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiovascular complications. Diabetes-induced myocardial dysfunction is characterized by myocardial fibrosis, which includes structural heart changes, myocardial cell death, and extracellular matrix protein accumulation. The mice groups in this study were divided as follows: Cont, control (db/m mice); T2DM, type 2 diabetes mellitus mice (db/db mice); Vil.G, db/db + vildagliptin 50 mg/kg/day, positive control, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor; Bla.C, db/db + blackcurrant 200 mg/kg/day. In this study, Bla.C treatment significantly improved the homeostatic model evaluation of glucose, insulin, and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) indices and diabetic blood markers such as HbA1c in T2DM mice. In addition, Bla.C improved cardiac function markers and cardiac thickening through echocardiography. Bla.C reduced the expression of fibrosis biomarkers, elastin and type IV collagen, in the left ventricle of a diabetic cardiopathy model. Bla.C also inhibited TD2M-induced elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines in cardiac tissue (IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, and TGF-β). Thus, Bla.C significantly improved cardiac inflammation and cardiovascular fibrosis and dysfunction by blocking inflammatory cytokine activation signals. This showed that Bla.C treatment could ameliorate diabetes-induced cardiovascular complications in T2DM mice. These results provide evidence that Bla.C extract has a significant effect on the prevention of cardiovascular fibrosis, inflammation, and consequent diabetes-induced cardiovascular complications, directly or indirectly, by improving blood glucose profile."

Unfortunately, such a condition does not spare children from also developing morbid obesity, where incidence rates of childhood obesity-coupled with type 2 diabetes-are markedly elevated. Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is gradually becoming the novel benchmark in bariatric surgery for the treatment of morbid obesity and associated co-morbidities, also within pediatric cases. However, no comprehensive study has been conducted in children that emphasizes the effect of LSG on HbA1C levels within such a patient population suffering from type 2 diabetes. Aim: Since HbA1C is a major biomarker for type 2 diabetes progression, this study aimed to identify any dysregulated serum levels for this key molecular player (together with other parameters), for post-surgical monitoring of the beneficial metabolic effects of LSG surgery on type 2 diabetes amelioration/remission within pediatric patients. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: A total of 64 pediatric patients, ranging in age from 5 to 14 years old, were enrolled in this retrospective study. Multiple laboratory-based analyses datasets were also collected from individual study participants, including HbA1C and random blood sugar (RBS). All participating patients were designated for undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy, as per standardized surgical protocols and each participant was followed-up for two years post-surgery. Laboratory investigations were re-performed in order to identify any major variations in clinical parameters. <i>Results</i>: HbA1c was significantly reduced among children, from 6.0 ± 0.8 (pre-LSG) to 5.4 ± 0.4 post-surgery, with a reduction rate of 10.9% (<i>p</i> = 0.001). Furthermore, RBS significantly decreased from 102.9 ± 34.0 (pre-LSG) to 87.1 ± 17.3 post- surgery, with a reduction rate of 15.4% (<i>p</i> = 0.036). <i>Conclusions</i>: This study provides further concrete evidence for the beneficial metabolic influence provided by LSG surgery on morbidly obese, childhood-aged patient populations, with effectiveness in reducing co-morbidity progress, in the form of type 2 diabetes, through the reduction in HbA1c levels within such patients post-surgery."

Intensive glucose control trials suggest that the 9% lower risk of MACE associated with intensive glycemic control, as compared with conventional glycemic control, is only driven by patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus without cardiovascular disease at baseline. Methods and Results We did a meta-analysis of cardiovascular outcome trials dividing patients with or without preexisting cardiovascular disease; we found that the lower risk of MACE is confined to patients with cardiovascular disease at baseline. Compared with placebo, the use of both glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors was associated with a significant 14% lower MACE risk in patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease and with a nonsignificant 2% higher MACE risk in those without preexisting cardiovascular disease ( P for interaction=0.021). The meta-regression analysis of all 12 trials demonstrated a significant ( P=0.002) association between reductions of glycated hemoglobin in glycated hemoglobin A<sub>1C</sub>. Accordingly, the reduction of MACE expected if all cardiovascular outcome trials had achieved a 0.9% glycated hemoglobin reduction would have been 33%. Routine clinical care data complement the results of cardiovascular outcome trials but with some differences: the lower risk of MACE with sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor use is evident in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with or without preexisting cardiovascular disease. Conclusions Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists should be included in the therapeutic plan of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and overt cardiovascular disease, with due attention paid to improvement of glycemic control, which may amplify their benefit on MACE."

There is a bidirectional pathological relationship between the two conditions, whereby NAFLD increases the risk of type 2 diabetes, and type 2 diabetes contributes to and accelerates the progression of NAFLD. Furthermore, over 30% of patients with NAFLD progress to non-alcoholic liver steatohepatitis (NASH), which then increases the risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Despite its high prevalence and the potential clinical implications, the underlying pathogenesis of NAFLD has yet to be fully elucidated, and there is no consensus regarding standard diagnosis and treatment for either NALFD or NASH. As patients with both NASH and type 2 diabetes have impaired hepatic function owing to chronic inflammation and the resulting structural changes caused by hepatic fat accumulation, they face reduced options for antidiabetic treatment. SGLT-2 inhibitors inhibit glucose reabsorption in the proximal tubule, with increased excretion of glucose in urine and decreased glucose levels in plasma, and their glycemia-lowering effect is insulin-independent. Several other beneficial effects have been reported for SGLT-2 inhibitors, including reduced risks of cardiovascular and renal diseases, improved blood pressure control, body weight reduction, and reductions in liver fat content. Experimental studies in mouse models have suggested that SGLT-2 inhibitors may have beneficial modulatory effects on NAFLD/NASH. Several trials in patients with type 2 diabetes have also suggested that these drugs may be useful in treating both type 2 diabetes and NAFLD or NASH. However, further research is needed to identify the mechanisms by which SGLT-2 inhibitors affect fatty liver and steatohepatitis. In this state-of-the-art review, we explore the literature on the efficacy of SGLT-2 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes and NASH, and present arguments for and against the use of SGLT-2 inhibitors in this patient population."

In this study, Mendelian randomisation (MR) analysis was applied to obtain unconfounded estimates of the casual association of genetically determined blood lead with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Data from the largest genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on blood lead, eGFR and CKD, from predominantly ethnically European populations, were analysed in total, as well as separately in individuals with or without type 2 diabetes mellitus. Inverse variance weighted (IVW) method, weighted median (WM)-based method, MR-Egger, MR-Pleiotropy RESidual Sum and Outlier (PRESSO) as well as the leave-one-out method were applied. In a general population, lifetime blood lead levels had no significant effect on risk of CKD (IVW: p = 0.652) and eGFR (IVW: p = 0.668). After grouping by type 2 diabetes status (no diabetes vs. diabetes), genetically higher levels of blood lead had a significant negative impact among subjects with type 2 diabetes (IVW = Beta: -0.03416, p = 0.0132) but not in subjects without (IVW: p = 0.823), with low likelihood of heterogeneity for any estimates (IVW p > 0.158). MR-PRESSO did not highlight any outliers. Pleiotropy test, with very negligible intercept and insignificant p-value, indicated a low likelihood of pleiotropy for all estimations. The leave-one-out method demonstrated that links were not driven by a single SNP. Our results show, for the first time, that among subjects with type 2 diabetes, higher blood lead levels are potentially related to less favourable renal function. Further studies are needed to confirm our results. KEY MESSAGES: What is already known about this subject? Chronic kidney disease is associated with unfavourable lifestyle behaviours and conditions such as type 2 diabetes. Observational studies have reported an association between blood lead and reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate, but the relationship between lead exposure and renal function remains controversial. What is the key question? Using Mendelian randomisation with data from 5433 individuals from the UK and Australian populations, does genetically determined blood lead have a potentially causal effect on estimated glomerular filtration rate and the risk of chronic kidney disease? What are the new findings? Blood lead levels have a potentially causal effect on reduced renal function in individuals with type 2 diabetes. In subjects without diabetes, no such causal relationship was identified. How might this impact on clinical practice in the foreseeable future? This highlights the risk of elevated blood lead, for example, due to environmental exposure, amongst those with type 2 diabetes, which may predispose them to impaired renal function."

Prediabetes may be reversed by weight loss, diet, and lifestyle changes. However, without intervention, between 30-50% of individuals with prediabetes develop type 2 diabetes. This retrospective population study was conducted to develop a predictive model of prediabetes and incident type 2 diabetes mellitus using data from 2004 to 2015 from the DRYAD Japanese hospital database. MATERIAL AND METHODS A retrospective longitudinal population study was conducted using the DRYAD database from Murakami Memorial Hospital, Gifu, Japan, to construct a predictive model for prediabetes and incident type 2 diabetes mellitus in the population. Univariate analysis and multivariate analysis were performed to identify the variables that were associated with prediabetes. These variables were used to construct (75% samples) and verify (25% samples) the predictive model. RESULTS From 2004 to 2015, a total of 11,113 cases were identified. Multivariate logistic regression analysis included the six variables of age, waist circumference, smoking history, the presence of fatty liver, fasting blood glucose (FBG), and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level. Data were used to construct (75% samples) and verify (25% samples) in a predictive model. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of the predictive model was 0.87 (0.85-0.89) in the training cohort and 0.87 (0.86-0.90) in the validation cohort. CONCLUSIONS A prognostic model based on six variables was predictive for incident type 2 diabetes mellitus and prediabetes in a healthy population in Japan."

The relationship between plasma concentration of the adipocytokines/regulatory peptides and parameters of renal function (albumin/creatinine ratio-ACR, estimated glomerular filtration rate-eGFR), values of insulin resistance indicators (Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR2), Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Sensitivity (HOMA-S), Homeostatic Model Assessment of β-cell function (HOMA-B), quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI), insulin), and parameters of carbohydrate-lipid metabolism (fasting plasma glucose-FPG, glycated hemoglobin-HbA<sub>1C</sub>, estimated glucose disposal rate-eGDR, fasting lipid profile, TG/HDL ratio) in obese type 2 diabetic patients was also investigated. Circulating irisin and vaspin were found significantly different in subjects with metabolically healthy obesity and in type 2 diabetic patients. Significant increases in blood levels of both analyzed adipokines/regulatory peptides were observed in diabetic patients after six months of metformin treatment, as compared to pre-treatment levels. The change in plasma vaspin level in response to metformin therapy was parallel with the improving of insulin resistance/sensitivity parameters. An attempt was made to identify a set of biochemical tests that would vary greatly in obese non-diabetic subjects and obese patients with type 2 diabetes, as well as a set of parameters that are changing in patients with type 2 diabetes under the influence of six months metformin therapy, and thus differentiating patients' metabolic state before and after treatment. For these data analyses, both statistical measures of strength of the relationships of individual parameters, as well as multidimensional methods, including discriminant analysis and multifactorial analysis derived from machine learning methods, were used. Adropin, irisin, and vaspin were found as promising regulatory molecules, which may turn out to be useful indicators in the early detection of T2DM and differentiating the obesity phenotype with normal metabolic profile from T2DM obese patients. Multifactorial discriminant analysis revealed that irisin and vaspin plasma levels contribute clinically relevant information concerning the effectiveness of metformin treatment in T2D patients. Among the sets of variables differentiating with the highest accuracy the metabolic state of patients before and after six-month metformin treatment, were: (1) vaspin, HbA1c, HDL, LDL, TG, insulin, and HOMA-B (ACC = 88 [%]); (2) vaspin, irisin, QUICKI, and eGDR (ACC = 86 [%]); as well as, (3) vaspin, irisin, LDL, HOMA-S, ACR, and eGFR (ACC = 86 [%])."

The molecular mechanisms that could cause the condition of T2DM need to be more thoroughly analysed to understand the clinical manifestations and to derive better therapeutic regimes. Tools in bioinformatics are used to trace out key gene elements and to identify the key causative gene elements and their possible therapeutic agents. Microarray datasets were retrieved from the Gene expression omnibus database and studied using R to derive different expressed gene (DEG) elements. With the comparison of the expressed genes with disease specific genes in DisGeNET, the final annotated genes were taken for analysis. Gene Ontology studies, Protein-protein interaction (PPI), Co-expression analysis, Gene-drug interactions were performed to scale down the hub genes and to identify the novelty across the genes analysed so far. <i>In vivo</i> and <i>invitro</i> analysis of key genes and the trace of interaction pathway is crucial to better understand the unique outcomes from the novel genes, forming the basis to understand the pathway that ends up causing T2DM.

They are effective in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus and have a favorable effect on weight loss. Their cardiovascular and renal safety has been extensively investigated and confirmed in many clinical trials. Recently, evidence has shown that in addition to the existing approaches for the treatment of obesity, semaglutide in higher doses promotes weight loss and can be used as a drug to treat obesity. However, some T2DM and obese patients do not achieve a desired therapeutic effect of GLP-1 receptor agonists. This could be due to the multifactorial etiologies of T2DM and obesity, but genetic variability in the GLP-1 receptor or signaling pathways also needs to be considered in non-responders to GLP-1 receptor agonists.

We included observational studies (cross-sectional, case-control, and cohort study) with information on lactation and type 2 diabetes mellitus incidence among women with previous GDM. We excluded case studies without control data. Data synthesis was conducted by random-effect meta-analysis. Fourteen reports of 9 studies were included. Overall risk of bias using RoBANS ranged from low to unclear. Longer lactation for more than 4 to 12 weeks postpartum had risk reduction of type 2 diabetes mellitus compared with shorter lactation (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.01-55.86; OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.35-0.89; OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.13-0.36; type 2 diabetes mellitus evaluation time < 2 y, 2-5 y, and >5 y, respectively). Exclusive lactation for more than 6 to 9 weeks postpartum also had lower risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus compared with exclusive formula (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.22-0.81).

The potential roles of lncRNAs in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are not well-known. In this study, we aim to assess the expression levels of LY86-AS1 and HCG27_201 in T2DM patients and a healthy control group. We obtained whole blood and serum samples from 100 T2DM and 100 non-diabetic subjects. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were extracted from whole blood samples using Ficoll. Total RNA was isolated from PBMCs obtained from patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and healthy control individuals using TRIzol LS reagent (GeneAll Biotechnology Co., LTD.). Extracted RNA was used to synthesize complementary DNA (cDNA) with a Reverse Transcription Kit (Takara). Real-time was performed with SYBR Green (Takara) and monitored by a Rotor-Gene (Qiagen) system. We performed quantitative PCR analysis of the LY86-AS1 and HCG27_201 lncRNA expression levels in the 200 samples. Here we found that the expression of LY86-AS1 and HCG27_201 were down regulated in the T2DM group compared with the control group. We further identify that the expression of both lncRNAs was negatively correlated with fasting blood sugar (FBS) levels. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to assess the diagnostic value of LY86-AS1 and HCG27_201 as biomarkers for T2DM. ROC analysis demonstrated that LY86-AS1 with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.747 (P < 0.0001, sensitivity: 64.6, and specificity: 79.8) might be the potential novel diagnostic biomarkers for T2DM. Lower expression of our two studied long non-coding RNAs LY86-AS1 and HCG27_201 in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients indicates their role in the pathogenesis of T2DM. Furthermore, LY86-AS1 could possibly be used as a diagnostic marker for T2DM."

In conclusion, this study substantiated that the lower ratio of n-6/n-3 PUFA (1:1 and 5:1) improve symptoms associated with T2DM via activating BAT. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Dietary ratio of n-6/n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids is essential for the improvement of chronic diseases. Our current study showed that 1:1 or 5:1 ratio of n-6/n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids had better efficiency for type 2 diabetes mellitus via activating brown adipose tissue when compared with 1:50. This finding provided useful guidance for the daily diet of patients with diabetes."

The type 2 diabetes mellitus patients were subdivided into 95 insulin-treated diabetes mellitus and 156 non-insulin-treated diabetes mellitus subjects. The crude incidences (per 1000 patient-years) in the type 2 diabetes mellitus subjects versus the non-type 2 diabetes mellitus subjects were 43.7 versus 25.1 for recurrent myocardial infarction, 68.7 versus 28.3 for all-cause death and 99.8 versus 49.9 for the composite end point (i.e. recurrent myocardial infarction or all-cause death). Cox regression analysis showed that the adjusted hazard ratios for recurrent myocardial infarction, all-cause death and their combination were 1.67 (95% confidence interval: 1.06-2.74), 1.90 (1.25-2.90) and 1.72 (1.23-2.40), respectively. Significant associations were also observed between insulin treatment and all-cause death.

To evaluate the contemporary landscape in which these recommendations would be implemented, we examined the use of these medications according to clinical guideline practice. Methods and Results In the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey for 2017 to 2018, we defined compelling indications for SGLT-2 inhibitors by the presence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease, and for GLP-1RAs by the presence of established or high-risk atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, based on large clinical trials that have been incorporated in guideline recommendations of the American College of Cardiology and American Diabetes Association. We then evaluated use of these medications among patients with physician-diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus. All analyses incorporated complex survey design to produce nationally representative estimates. A total 1104 of 9254 sampled individuals had type 2 diabetes mellitus, representing 10.6% (95% CI, 9.7%-11.6%) of the US population or 33.2 million adults nationally. Of these, 52.6% (95% CI, 47.7%-57.5%) had an indication for SGLT-2 inhibitors, 32.8% (95% CI, 28.8%-37.2%) for GLP-1RAs, and 26.6% (95% CI, 22.2%-31.7%) for both medications. During 2017 to 2018, 4.5% (95% CI, 2.4%-8.2%) were treated with SGLT-2 inhibitors and 1.5% (95% CI, 0.7%-3.2%) with GLP-1RAs. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease were not independently associated with SGLT-2 inhibitor or GLP-1RA use in patients with diabetes mellitus. Conclusions Despite a large number of patients being eligible for guideline-recommended cardiorenal protective therapies, there are substantial gaps in the use of SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1RAs, limiting their public health benefits."

However, the mechanism of action of red ginseng on type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) at the metabolic level is still unclear. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of red ginseng extract in the treatment of T2DM rats based on untargeted metabolomics. The rat model of T2DM was induced by a high-fat diet (HFD) combined with streptozotocin (STZ), and serum samples were collected after four weeks of treatment. The ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with Q Exactive HF-X Mass Spectrometer was used to analyze the level of metabolites in serum to evaluate the differences in metabolic levels between different groups. The results of biochemical analysis showed that red ginseng extract intervention significantly improved the levels of total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), serum glucose (GLU), and fasting insulin (FINS) after four weeks. Orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis was used to study the overall changes of rat metabolomics. After the intervention of red ginseng extract, 50 biomarkers showed a callback trend. Metabolic pathway enrichment analysis showed that the regulated pathways were D-arginine and D-ornithine metabolism, D-glutamine and D-glutamate metabolism, taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, arginine biosynthesis, and tryptophan metabolism. Generally, the results demonstrated that red ginseng extract had beneficial effects on T2DM, which could be mediated via ameliorating the metabolic disorders."

Prolong diabetes has been related with microvascular complications especially diabetic nephropathy. DN is the most common complication of type 2 diabetes mellitus, and it is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease worldwide. It is crucial to diagnose patients who are more sensible to develop DN for better control of the process of disease. Several factors and mechanisms contribute to the development and outcome of diabetic nephropathy. Microalbuminuria is an early marker of DN and use it as a routine for screening, but the renal damages may be happening even without microalbuminuria. There are several significant kidney damage and disease biomarkers which helps in early detection of DN. An early biomarker may allow earlier diagnosis, treatment reduces DN prevalence and slows DN progression. Therefore, this review focuses on laboratory biomarkers that are earlier, more validation of an early and specific biomarker could potentially make it possible for early diagnosis, treatment, and retardation of progression of diabetic nephropathy."

The mechanism of their action is based on insulin-independent reduction of glucose reabsorption in the proximal renal tubules, which leads to stimulation of its excretion in the urine and, accordingly, to a decrease in the concentration of glucose in the blood plasma. Drugs of this group demonstrate effectiveness in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but their use may be associated with an increased frequency of urinary tract infections. Pharmacological glucosuria, which leads to a decrease in the concentration of glucose in the blood, creates the preconditions for the occurrence of urinary tract infections. Urinary tract and genital infections are the most common adverse events associated with the use of sodium-glucose cotransporter inhibitors. In the presented literature review for 20162019, the relationship between urinary tract infections in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and therapy with sodium-glucose cotransporter inhibitors was analyzed."

(Chaos, 2021, 31, 023142)). This paper assesses the impact of DIU on the ability of the glucose-insulin system to maintain homeostasis when responding to the ingestion of meals. We address two questions. First, what is the nature of the DIU phenotype? That is, what physiological macrostates (as encoded by physiological parameters) allow for DIU onset? Second, how does DIU impact health? We find that the DIU phenotype is abundant in the space of intrinsic parameters for the Ultradian glucose-insulin model-a model that has been successfully used to predict glucose-insulin dynamics in humans. Configurations of intrinsic parameters that correspond to high characteristic glucose levels facilitate DIU onset. We argue that DIU is pathogenic for obesity and type-2 diabetes mellitus by linking the statistical profile of DIU to the glucostatic theory of hunger."

Recent evidence suggests that sleep timing variability (the day-to-day fluctuations of sleep timing) may be an important factor in metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus. In the current study, we explore the associations between measures of sleep timing variability and cardiometabolic measures in a group of healthy middle-aged adults with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus. Healthy controls (N = 27) and adults with well-controlled uncomplicated type 2 diabetes mellitus (N = 30) wore actiwatches for an average of 9 days for objective assessment of sleep timing parameters, and also underwent a detailed clinical assessment. We found greater self-reported social jetlag in the diabetes group, but no groupwise differences in measures of sleep timing variability. In the diabetes patients, HbA1c levels were inversely correlated with variability in the time of sleep onset and midsleep, and with sleep duration. HOMA-IR did not correlate with any sleep timing variability measure, nor were there associations between sleep timing variability and other metabolic biomarkers (cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides and uric acid). Systolic blood pressure was inversely correlated with actigraphically defined social jetlag in both the control and diabetes groups. The results of this study indicate associations between sleep timing variability and HbA1c, but the direction of these relationships is at variance with some other recent reports. Our results indicate a need for future hypothesis-testing studies to further explore the impact of sleep timing variance on metabolic health."

The implications of having type 2 diabetes mellitus with well-controlled metabolic risk factors compared to an increasing burden of uncontrolled metabolic risk factors on left ventricular structure and function are not known. Methods and Results We compared patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (n=751) with different degrees of uncontrolled metabolic risk factors present with a control group of individuals without present uncontrolled metabolic risk factors as recommended by the World Health Organization (n=80). In patients with well-controlled metabolic risk factors, only diastolic but neither structural nor systolic measures were impaired compared to the control group: the (early diastolic mitral inflow velocity)/(atrial diastolic mitral inflow velocity) ratio (median 0.94 [interquartile range 0.80, 1.08] versus 1.11 [0.85, 1.38], P<0.001), lateral early diastolic myocardial velocity at the level of the mitral annulus (mean 9.6 m/s [SD 2.5] versus 10.8 [3.5], P<0.001) and lateral (early diastolic mitral inflow velocity)/(early diastolic myocardial velocity at the level of the mitral annulus) (7.7 [6.5, 10.2] versus 6.3 [4.9, 7.8], P<0.001). With an increasing burden of uncontrolled metabolic risk factors, there were increased left ventricular mass index and wall thicknesses and impaired systolic function measured as global longitudinal strain: control group -15.9 (2.0); 0 uncontrolled risk factors -15.3 (2.4); 1 to 2 -14.6 (2.8); and ≥3 -14.0 (2.8), P<0.001. Within the diabetes mellitus group, there were uni- and multivariable associations of left ventricular measures and systolic blood pressure, body mass index, hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub>, and HDL -cholesterol. Conclusions In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, having well-controlled metabolic risk factors was associated with only left ventricular diastolic impairment but not with either structural or even subtle measures of systolic function.

The protective effect of the polymorphic gene variant remained significant in individuals who consumed fresh vegetables and fruits (p=0.014), proteins (p=0.0017), and did not consume carbohydrate- and fat-reach food (p=0.0047). The association of the minor allele rs1046495-C with type 2 diabetes mellitus can be explained by its more pronounced effect on the expression of the GFER enzyme that through glutathionation maintains the ROS level for optimal functioning of complexes III and IV of the electron transport chain and promotes the formation of disulfide bonds in the CHCHD4 chaperone molecule.

There is a notable decrease in glucose uptake in the skeletal muscle of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). Endurance exercise can reduce hyperglycemia and improve insulin resistance in patients with type 2 DM. Insulin exerts a variety of effects, many of which are mediated by Akt, including increasing glucose uptake, promoting glycogen synthesis and inhibiting glycogen degradation, increasing free fatty acid uptake, increasing protein synthesis, promoting muscle hypertrophy and inhibiting protein degradation. Skeletal muscle mass progressively declines with aging, resulting in loss of muscle strength and physical function. Sarcopenia is a syndrome characterized by loss of skeletal muscle mass and muscle weakness or loss of physical function, and frailty is another syndrome that has received great interest in recent years. Decreased organ function results in vulnerability to external stress. Frailty is associated with falls, fractures and hospitalization; however, there is the reversibility of returning to a healthy state with appropriate interventions. Frailty is classified into three subgroups: Physical frailty, social frailty and cognitive frailty, whereby sarcopenia is the main component of physical frailty. The present review discusses the associations between sarcopenia, frailty and type 2 DM based on current evidence."

Literature searches were conducted on Medline, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Registry, and ClinicalTrials.gov . RCTs that assessed the effects on left ventricular diastolic function of OADs and GLP-1RAs in patients with type 2 diabetes were included. The outcome was the value (E/e') obtained by dividing peak early diastolic transmitral flow velocity (E) by the mitral annular early diastolic velocity (e'). Standardized mean differences (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated from a random-effects network meta-analysis. Eight RCTs (592 patients) identified in a literature search met the eligibility criteria for this study and were included in the network meta-analysis. Compared with placebo, liraglutide was the only drug that caused a significant improvement in left ventricular diastolic function (SMD, - 0.65; 95% CI, - 1.23 to - 0.08). In addition, when the effects on left ventricular diastolic function were evaluated across drugs, liraglutide alone caused a significant improvement in left ventricular diastolic function compared with OADs (sitagliptin, linagliptin, pioglitazone, rosiglitazone, voglibose, and glimepiride). From the perspective of preventing the onset of heart failure, the administration of liraglutide for type 2 diabetes is promising."

Recent research suggests that type-2 diabetes adversely impacts neuronal integrity and function, yet little work has considered how these neuronal changes affect sensorimotor outcomes after stroke. Here, we considered how type-2 diabetes impacted the structural and metabolic function of the sensorimotor cortex after stroke using volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). We hypothesized that the combination of chronic stroke and type-2 diabetes would negatively impact the integrity of sensorimotor cortex as compared to individuals with chronic stroke alone. Compared to stroke alone, individuals with stroke and diabetes had lower cortical thickness bilaterally in the primary somatosensory cortex, and primary and secondary motor cortices. Individuals with stroke and diabetes also showed reduced creatine levels bilaterally in the sensorimotor cortex. Contralesional primary and secondary motor cortex thicknesses were negatively related to sensorimotor outcomes in the paretic upper-limb in the stroke and diabetes group such that those with thinner primary and secondary motor cortices had better motor function. These data suggest that type-2 diabetes alters cerebral energy metabolism, and is associated with thinning of sensorimotor cortex after stroke. These factors may influence motor outcomes after stroke."

Carriers of <i>TT</i> genotype and <i>T</i> allele had a lower response to metformin compared to carriers of <i>CC</i>/<i>CT</i> genotypes and <i>C</i> allele (<i>p</i>-value = 0.0246, <i>p</i>-value = 0.0059, respectively). To identify the parameters that had the greatest importance for the prediction of the therapy response to metformin, we next built a set of machine learning models, based on the various combinations of genetic and phenotypic characteristics. The model based on a set of four parameters, including gender, rs12208357 genotype, familial T2DM background, and waist-hip ratio (WHR) showed the highest prediction accuracy for the response to metformin therapy in patients with T2DM (AUC = 0.62 in cross-validation). Further pharmacogenetic studies may aid in the discovery of the fundamental mechanisms of type 2 diabetes, the identification of new drug targets, and finally, it could advance the development of personalized treatment."

Among many molecules regulating vascular tone, nitric oxide appears to be the most pivotal. Although micro- and macrovascular-abnormalities are extensively studied, the alterations in the nitric-oxide-metabolic-pathway require further investigations. Additionally, the role of erythrocytes in the vascular tone regulation has not been extensively explored. The aim of this study was to evaluate the endothelial-function and the nitric-oxide-metabolic-pathway in erythrocytes and plasma of diabetic individuals. (2) Methods: A total of 80 subjects were enrolled in this cross-sectional study, including 35 patients with DM and 45 healthy individuals. The endothelial-function was evaluated in response to different stimuli. (3) Results: In the DM group, decreased Arginine and citrulline concentrations in the plasma compartment with reduced Arginine/ADMA and ADMA/DMA-ratios were observed. Preserved nitric-oxide-metabolism in erythrocytes with reduced citrulline level and significantly higher NO-bioavailability were noted.

Type-2 diabetes mellitus is a disease for which several gene polymorphisms have been reported to be associated with drug response. Sulfonylureas are commonly used for the management of this disease. Genetic polymorphisms of CYP2C9, the main enzyme involved in the metabolism of sulfonylureas, have been associated with the risk of severe hypoglycaemia, particularly in poor metabolizers carrying CYP2C9 *3/*3 genotype, and especially in the case of patients treated with glimepiride. The objectives of the present study were to evaluate the potential clinical and economic outcomes of using CYP2C9 genotype data to guide the management of SU regimen in patients initiating glimepiride therapy, and to identify factors affecting the cost-effectiveness of this treatment scheme. The analysis was conducted using a decision tree, considering a 1-year time horizon, and taking as perspective that of the French national health insurance system. With pharmacogenetic-guided therapy, the cost to avoid an episode of severe hypoglycaemia event per 100 000 patients treated was €421 834. Genotyping cost was the most influential factor on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. In conclusion, the potential cost of CYP2C9 genotype-guided dosing for glimepiride therapy is relatively high, and associated with modest improvements with respect to the number of hypoglycaemia avoided, as compared with standard dosing. Additional economic studies are required to better specify the usefulness of CYP2C9 genotyping prior to glimepiride regimen initiation."

The theory of salutogenesis, which focuses on the resources required to organize behavioural changes in everyday life, was used to develop an intervention for healthy eating. The aim was to describe the development, structure and content of this salutogenic intervention. The development consisted of two phases that were based on the operationalization of important key principles of salutogenesis. In Phase 1 (Exploration and synthesis), a systematic review and three qualitative studies were performed to explore important characteristics to enable healthy eating in everyday life. The results were used to develop the draft intervention. In Phase 2 (Validation and adjustment), interviews and workshops were conducted with T2DM patients, healthcare providers and scientists. Based on this, the draft intervention was modified into its final form. The developmental process resulted in a 12-week, group-based intervention that aimed to enable important resources for healthy eating via self-examination, reflection, setting goals and sharing experiences. Attention was also paid to disease information, disease acceptance, food literacy, stress management, self-identity and social support. The group sessions began following an individual intake session, with a booster session held 3 months after the intervention.

The projections estimate that 439 million people will be diabetic in 2030. T2DM is characterized by an impaired β-pancreatic cell function and insulin secretion, hyperglycemia and insulin resistance, and recently the epigenetic regulation of β-pancreatic cells differentiation has been underlined as being involved. It is currently known that several bioactive molecules, widely abundant in plants used as food or infusions, have a key role in histone modification and DNA methylation, and constituted potential epidrugs candidates against T2DM. In this sense, in this review the epigenetic mechanisms involved in T2DM and protein targets are reviewed, with special focus in studies addressing the potential use of phytochemicals as epidrugs that prevent and/or control T2DM <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>. As main findings, and although some controversial results have been found, bioactive molecules with epigenetic regulatory function, appear to be a potential replacement/complementary therapy of pharmacological hypoglycemic drugs, with minimal side effects.

A few studies have investigated the separate effects of diet and exercise training on cardiac function, but none have investigated myocardial changes in response to a combined diet and exercise intervention. This 12-week randomized study assessed the effects of a Paleolithic diet, with and without additional supervised exercise training, on cardiac fat, structure, and function. Methods and Results Twenty-two overweight and obese subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus were randomized to either a Paleolithic diet and standard-care exercise recommendations ( PD ) or to a Paleolithic diet plus supervised exercise training 3 hours per week ( PD - EX ). This study includes secondary end points related to cardiac structure and function, ie, myocardial triglycerides levels, cardiac morphology, and strain were measured using cardiovascular magnetic resonance, including proton spectroscopy, at baseline and after 12 weeks. Both groups showed major favorable metabolic changes. The PD - EX group showed significant decreases in myocardial triglycerides levels (-45%, P=0.038) and left ventricle mass to end-diastolic volume ratio (-13%, P=0.008) while the left ventricle end-diastolic volume and stroke volume increased significantly (+14%, P=0.004 and +17%, P=0.008, respectively). These variables were unchanged in the PD group.

Risk factors, such as age, gender, and obesity, were associated with COVID-19 infection. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is known to use several host receptors for viral entry, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) in the lung and other organs. However, ACE2 could be shed from the surface to be soluble ACE2 (sACE2) in the circulation. The epigenetic factors affecting ACE2 expression include a type of small non-coding RNAs called microRNAs (miRNAs). In this study, we aimed at exploring the status of the sACE2 as well as serum levels of several upstream novel miRNAs as non-invasive biomarkers that might have a potential role in T2DM patients. Serum samples were collected from 50 T2DM patients and 50 healthy controls, and sACE2 levels were quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Also, RNA was extracted, and TaqMan miRNA reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was performed to measure serum miRNA levels. Our results revealed that sACE2 is decreased in the T2DM patients and is affected by age, gender, and obesity level. Additionally, 4 miRNAs, which are revealed by in silico analysis to be potentially upstream of ACE2 were detectable in the serum. Among them, miR-421 level was found to be decreased in the serum of diabetic patients, regardless of the presence or absence of diabetic complications, as well as being differential in various body mass index (BMI) groups. The other 3 miRNAs (miR-3909, miR-212-5p, and miR-4677-3p) showed associations with multiple factors including age, gender, BMI, and serum markers, in addition to being correlated to each other. In conclusion, our study reveals a decline in the circulating serum levels of sACE2 in T2DM patients and identified 4 novel miRNAs that were associated with T2DM, which are influenced by different clinical and demographic factors."

However, the overall diet may contain many antioxidants with additive or synergistic effects. Therefore, we aimed to determine associations between total dietary antioxidant capacity and risk of type 2 diabetes, prediabetes and insulin resistance. We estimated the dietary antioxidant capacity for 5796 participants of the Rotterdam Study using a ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) score. Of these participants, 4957 had normoglycaemia and 839 had prediabetes at baseline. We used covariate-adjusted proportional hazards models to estimate associations between FRAP and risk of type 2 diabetes, risk of type 2 diabetes among participants with prediabetes, and risk of prediabetes. We used linear regression models to determine the association between FRAP score and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). We observed 532 cases of incident type 2 diabetes, of which 259 among participants with prediabetes, and 794 cases of incident prediabetes during up to 15 years of follow-up. A higher FRAP score was associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes among the total population (HR per SD FRAP 0.84, 95% CI 0.75; 0.95) and among participants with prediabetes (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.73; 0.99), but was not associated with risk of prediabetes. Dietary FRAP was also inversely associated with HOMA-IR (β - 0.04, 95% CI - 0.06; - 0.03). Effect estimates were generally similar between sexes. The findings of this population-based study emphasize the putative beneficial effects of a diet rich in antioxidants on insulin resistance and risk of type 2 diabetes."

This study was carried out to observe hepatocellular injury in type 2 Diabetes mellitus as evidenced by raised Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) among the type 2 Diabetes mellitus patients and to find out association between elevated ALT and glycaemic control. This was a descriptive cross-sectional comparative study carried out in Department of Medicine, Rajshahi Medical College Hospital and Rajshahi Diabetic Association Hospital, Rajshahi, Bangladesh from July 2009 to June 2010. One hundred (100) diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients according to WHO criteria and 30 apparently healthy people of both sexes were included. Age of the study people were >40 years. All of those study population were free from taking any hepatotoxic drugs, inj. Insulin, alcohol and preexisting liver disease. Detailed History, thorough clinical examination and relevant investigations were done for exclusion. The frequency of abnormal ALT, Serum bilirubin, Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), Alkaline phosphatase, Prothrombin time and Serum albumin were 30%, 6%, 7%, 6%, 54% and 12% respectively in type 2 diabetic patients and 3.3%, 00%, 00%, 6.7%, 10% and 3.3% respectively in normal people. Serum ALT (U/L) level (mean±SD) of the type 2 diabetic patients and normal people were (39.00±24.21) and (28.26±6.67) respectively. This difference is highly significant (p<0.001). Elevated serum ALT level of type 2 diabetic patients showed positive association with increased Body mass index (BMI) (p<0.05) and poor glycaemic control (p<0.05) and fatty liver (p=0.055). So, a high proportion of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus have raised serum Alanine aminotransferase level. Elevated serum ALT level was also associated with high BMI, poor glycaemic control and fatty liver which may be a marker of NAFLD and insulin resistance."

This study evaluated the clinical efficacy of an add-on therapy with DLBS3233 in type-2 diabetes mellitus subjects inadequately controlled by metformin and other oral antidiabetes. MethodsThis was an open and prospective clinical study for 12 weeks of therapy, involving type-2 diabetes mellitus patients who had been treated with two oral antidiabetic agents for at least 3 months prior to screening, yet, with HbA1c level was still beyond 7.0 %. DLBS3233 was given orally at the dose of 100 mg once daily in addition to their baseline oral antidiabetes medication. The primary end point was the reduction of HbA1c level; and the secondary end points were changes of fasting and 1-h postprandial glucose, homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance, adiponectin, and lipid profile, from their respective baseline. Results After 12 weeks of treatment, the HbA1c level was reduced by 0.65±1.58 % (p=0.001) from baseline (9.67±2.11 %); while the 1-h-PG level was reduced by -1.45±3.89 mmol/L (p=0.021) from baseline (15.29±4.49 mmol/L). Insulin sensitivity, lipid profile and adiponectin level were improved to a considerable extent. DLBS3233 did not adversely affect body weight, liver, and renal function. Most adverse events observed were tolerably mild and they all had been resolved by the end of the study. ConclusionsThe add-on oral antidiabetes therapy with DLBS3233 at the dose of 100 mg once daily helped type-2 diabetes mellitus patients to improve their glycemic control, enhance insulin sensitivity, lipid profile, and adiponectin level. In addition, DLBS3233 treatment concomitantly with other oral antidiabetic agents was proven safe and tolerable in type-2 diabetes subjects."

From January 2017 to April 2019, in Endocrinology Department for Outpatients and Inpatients of the First Affiliated Hospital of Henan University of Chinese Medicine, 125 elderly patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and type H hypertension with carotid artery vulnerable plaque(Qi-Yin deficiency with phlegm stagnation) were selected. According to the numerical table method, the patients were randomly divided into the control group(63 cases, including 56 cases completed) and Xiaoji group(62 cases, including 58 cases completed). Both groups were given control diet, hypoglycemic, hypotensive and symptomatic therapies. The control group was given Rosuvastatin Calcium Tablets 20 mg·d~(-1) before sleep. The Xiaojie group were given Ruisuvastatin Calcium Tablets 10 mg·d~(-1) before sleep, plus Xiaoji Recipe at the same time. Both groups were treated for 6 months. The number of vulnerable plaques, carotid intima-media thickness(IMT) and plaque thickness were detected by color Doppler ultrasound before and after treatment, in order to calculate IMT integral and improved Crouse integral. Meanwhile, lipid metabolism indexes, including total cholesterol(TC), triacylglycerol(TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol(LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol(HDL-C) and lipoprotein a(LPa). And plaque stability indexes, including hypersensitive c-reactive protein(hs-CRP), matrix metalloproteinase-9(MMP-9), oxidized low-density lipoprotein(ox-LDL), Ⅰ type platelet depolymerization protein binding protein base sequence of metalloproteinases(ADAMTS-Ⅰ) and homocysteine(Hcy) were detected. To evaluate the 6-month curative effect on TCM syndrome, the patients were followed up for 6 months for adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events and adverse drug reactions. After 6 months of treatment, the efficacy on Xiaoji group was better than that of the control group(Z=-2.600, P=0.009). The significant efficiency of the Xiaoji group was higher than that of the control group(χ~2=6.039, P=0.014). The total effective rate of the Xiaoji group was higher than that of the control group(χ~2=4.564, P=0.033). The number of vulnerable plaques form indexes(IMT, IMT integral, plaque thickness, improved Crouse integral), blood lipid metabolism indexes(TC, TG, LDL-C, HDL-C, LPa) and plaque stability indexes(hs-CRP, MMP-9, ox-LDL, ADAMTS-Ⅰ, Hcy) were significantly improved than before treatment in both groups of patients(P&lt;0.01). Compared with the control group, the Xiaoji group showed more obvious improvement(P&lt;0.01). The incidence of adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events in the Xiaoji group was lower than that in the control group within 6 months after treatment(χ~2=4.566, P=0.033). The incidence of adverse drug reactions in the Xiaoji group was lower than that in the control group(χ~2=4.465, P=0.035). This indicated that Xiaoji Recipe combined with small-dose Rosuvastatin Calcium(10 mg·d~(-1)) was safe and effective in the treatment of elderly patients of type 2 diabetes mellitus with type H hypertension and vulnerable carotid artery plaque(Qi-Yin deficiency with phlegm stagnation), and superior to the single high-dose Risovastatin Calcium(20 mg·d~(-1)) regimen. It can reverse carotid plaque, and reduce the activity of vulnerable plaque and the incidence of adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events and adverse drug reactions."

Both T2DM and hypogonadism are associated with impaired bone health and increased fracture risk but whether the combination results in even worse bone disease than either one alone is not well-studied. It is possible that having both conditions predisposes men to an even greater risk for fracture than either one alone. Given the common occurrence of HH or hypogonadism in general in T2DM, a significant number of men could be at risk. To date, there is very little information on the bone health men with both hypogonadism and T2DM. Insulin resistance, which is the primary defect in T2DM, is associated with low testosterone (T) levels in men and may play a role in the bidirectional relationship between these two conditions, which together may portend a worse outcome for bone. The present manuscript aims to review the available evidences on the effect of the combination of hypogonadism and T2DM on bone health and metabolic profile, highlights the possible metabolic role of the skeleton, and examines the pathways involved in the interplay between bone, insulin resistance, and gonadal steroids."

Current evidence points out a leading role of enterocyte in dyslipidemia of type 2 diabetes mellitus, since it increases the production of apolipoprotein B-48 in response to a raise in plasma free fatty acids and glucose. The chylomicron metabolism is regulated by many factors apart from ingested fat, including hormonal and metabolic elements. More recently, studies about the role of gut hormones, have demonstrated that glucagon-like peptide-1 decreases the production of apolipoprotein B-48 and glucagon-like peptide-2 enhances it. Insulin acutely inhibits intestinal chylomicron production in healthy humans, whereas this acute inhibitory effect on apolipoprotein B-48 production is blunted in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Understanding these emerging regulators of intestinal chylomicron secretion may offer new mechanisms of control for its metabolism and provide novel therapeutic strategies focalized in type 2 diabetes mellitus postprandial hyperlipidemia with the reduction of cardiovascular disease risk."

In the form of two different multi-protein complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, mTOR integrates cellular energy, nutrient and hormonal signals to regulate cellular metabolic homeostasis. In type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), pathological conditions and end-organ complications can be attributed to aberrant mTOR. Substantial evidence suggests that two mTOR-mediated signaling schemes, mTORC1-p70S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) and mTORC2-protein kinase B (AKT), play a critical role in insulin sensitivity and that their dysfunction contributes to the development of T2DM. This review summarizes our current understanding of the role of mTOR signaling in T2DM and its associated complications, as well as the potential use of mTOR inhibitors in the treatment of T2DM."

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the most common cause of morbidity and mortality among persons with Type 2 DM. In this work we evaluated the relationship between CVD and medication adherence to antihypertensives, oral hypoglycemic agents, and antidepressants among patients with Type 2 DM. We also sought to understand how patients perceived barriers to and facilitators of adherence to medications. Adherence to medications was measured in 72 primary care patients from the West Philadelphia area using electronic monitoring (Medication Event Monitoring System caps) over 12 weeks. Standard questions assessed the presence of CVD. Participants answered open-ended questions about barriers to and facilitators of medication adherence. Participants who had CVD were significantly less likely to achieve ≥80% adherence to an antidepressant, oral hypoglycemic agent, and antihypertensive medications at 12 weeks. Participants identified four themes related to medication adherence: Interference from Psychosocial Demands, Need for Technological Innovation, Awareness of Disease Severity, and Integrating Community Linkages. Interventions to improve medication adherence among persons with Type 2 DM in underserved communities may aim to address social determinants of health, create community linkages, emphasize disease severity and utilize apps which are integrated with existing primary care services."

The multifactorial etiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus is relative to many gene and molecule alterations, and increased insulin resistance. Besides these, however, there are still other predisposing and risk factors accounting for type 2 diabetes mellitus not to be identified and recognized. Emerging evidence indicated that defects in galanin function played a crucial role in development of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Galanin homeostasis is tightly relative to insulin resistance and is regulated by blood glucose. Hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinism, enhanced plasma galanin levels and decreased galanin receptor activities are some of the characters of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The discrepancy between high insulin level and low glucose handling is named as insulin resistance. Similarly, the discrepancy between high galanin level and low glucose handling may be denominated as galanin resistance too. In this review, the characteristic milestones of type 2 diabetes mellitus were condensed as two analogical conceptual models, obesity-hyper-insulin-insulin resistance-type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity-hyper-galanin-galanin resistance-type 2 diabetes mellitus. Both galanin resistance and insulin resistance are correlative with each other. Conceptualizing the etiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus as a disorder of galanin resistance may inspire a new concept to deepen our knowledge about pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus, eventually leading to novel preventive and therapeutic interventions for type 2 diabetes mellitus.

We conducted a 5-year longitudinal study among adolescents with normal-weight, obesity, and/or type 2 diabetes mellitus to examine trajectories of early vascular aging. Methods and Results Adolescents (mean [SD] age 17.6 [3.5]; 35.3% male) had either normal weight (n=141), obesity (n=156), or type 2 diabetes mellitus (n=151) at baseline. Primary metrics used for early vascular aging included measures of vascular structure (carotid intima-media thickness [cIMT]; common, internal, and bulb) and arterial stiffness (carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, and augmentation index). Longitudinal (5-year) outcomes were examined using generalized estimating equations adjusting for baseline value, sex, race, and age.

In the three cohorts pooled and analyzed together, no association between PPARγ2 P12A and all-cause mortality was observed (HR 1.02, 95 % CI 0.79-1.33). Similar results were observed after adjusting for age, sex, smoking habits, and BMI (HR 1.09, 95 % CI 0.83-1.43). In a meta-analysis of ours and all studies previously published (n = 3241 individuals; 666 events), no association was observed between PPARγ2 P12A and all-cause mortality (HR 1.07, 95 % CI 0.85-1.33). Results from our individual samples as well as from our meta-analysis suggest that the PPARγ2 P12A does not significantly affect all-cause mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus."

Studies have established that T2DM increases the risk of neurodegenerative disorders. This study aimed to determine the age-related prevalence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in T2DM patients in the Indian population and to identify link between cognitive dysfunction in T2DM patients and serum lipid composition through untargeted and targeted lipidomic studies. Using a cross-sectional study, we evaluated 1278 T2DM patients with Montreal cognitive assessment test (MoCA) and digit symbol substitution test (DSST) for cognitive functions. As per MoCA, the prevalences of MCI in T2DM patients in age groups below 40, 41-50, 51-60, 61-70, 71-80 and 81-90 years were 13.7, 20.5, 33.5, 43.7, 57.1 and 75% with DSST scores of 45.8, 41.7, 34.4, 30.5, 24.2 and 18.8% respectively. Binomial logistic regression analysis revealed serum HbA1c ≥ 7.51, duration of T2DM over 20 years, age above 41 years, and females were independent contributors for cognitive dysfunction in T2DM patients. Preliminary studies with untargeted lipidomics of the serum from 20 T2DM patients, including MCI and normal cognition (NC) group, identified a total of 646 lipids. Among the identified lipids, 33 lipids were significantly different between MCI and NC group, which comprised of triglycerides (TGs, 14), sphingolipids (SL, 11), and phosphatidylcholines (PC, 5). Importantly, 10 TGs and 3 PCs containing long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) were lower, while 8 sphingolipids were increased in the MCI group. Since brain-derived sphingolipids are known to get enriched in the serum, we further quantified sphingolipids from the same 20 serum samples through targeted lipidomic analysis, which identified a total of 173 lipids. Quantitation revealed elevation of 3 species of ceramides, namely Cer (d18:1_24:1), Hex1Cer (d16:0_22:6), and Hex2Cer (d28:1) in the MCI group compared to the NC group of T2DM patients. Overall, this study demonstrated an age-related prevalence of MCI in T2DM patients and highlighted reduced levels of several species of PUFA containing TGs and PCs and increased levels of specific ceramides in T2DM patients exhibiting MCI. Large-scale lipidomic studies in future could help understand the cognitive dysfunction domain in T2DM patients, while studies with preclinical models are required to understand the functional significance of the identified lipids."

However, current treatment options have limited benefits. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the fastest growing factor that causes HCC in western countries, including the United States. In addition, NAFLD co-morbidities including obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) promote HCC development. Alteration of metabolites and inflammation in the tumor microenvironment plays a pivotal role in HCC progression. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are still not totally clear. Herein, in this review, we explored the latest molecules that are involved in obesity, T2DM, and CVDs-mediated progression of HCC, as they share some common pathologic features. Meanwhile, several therapeutic options by targeting these key factors and molecules were discussed for HCC treatment. Overall, obesity, T2DM, and CVDs as chronic metabolic disease factors are tightly implicated in the development of HCC and its progression. Molecules and factors involved in these NAFLD comorbidities are potential therapeutic targets for HCC treatment."

This review discusses the role of vitamin D in the glycaemic control of individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus and evaluates the effect of vitamin D supplementation on glycaemic markers in this population. Literature searches were performed in the BIREME, LILACS, and PubMed databases using the Medical Subject Headings and words related to vitamin D, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and glycaemic control. Interventional and observational studies were considered eligible. The evaluation of the included studies was independently performed by 2 evaluators at all stages of selection, data extraction, and bias risk assessment. The primary outcome was the relationship between vitamin D levels and glucose metabolism markers in type 2 diabetes mellitus individuals. The secondary outcome was the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the glycaemic control markers in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The inverse relationship between vitamin D and variables of glucose metabolism was verified. Interventional studies revealed that vitamin D supplementation did not alter glycaemic control markers in most studies. Few studies have shown positive effects with a significant reduction in the percentage of glycated haemoglobin, insulin, and glucose concentrations, and changes in homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance and beta cell, and quantitative insulin sensitivity check index. Therefore, despite the association of vitamin D with glucose metabolism, there is insufficient evidence of the beneficial effects of its supplementation on the metabolic control of type 2 diabetes mellitus."

This is partly due to insulin resistance in the brain. Insulin signaling and the number of insulin receptors may decline in the brain of T2DM patients, resulting in impaired synaptic formation, neuronal plasticity, and mitochondrial metabolism. In AD patients, hypometabolism of glucose in the brain is observed before the onset of symptoms. Amyloid-β accumulation, a main pathology of AD, also relates to impaired insulin action and glucose metabolism, although ketone metabolism is not affected. Therefore, the shift from glucose metabolism to ketone metabolism may be a reasonable pathway for neuronal protection. To promote ketone metabolism, medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) oil and a ketogenic diet could be introduced as an alternative source of energy in the brain of AD patients."

There is uncertainty about the consistency of the cardiovascular benefits achieved across patient subsets. Methods and Results We included 4 large-scale trials of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibition compared with placebo in patients with diabetes mellitus that reported effects on cardiovascular outcomes overall and for participant subgroups defined at baseline by cardiovascular disease, reduced kidney function, and heart failure. Fixed effects models with inverse variance weighting were used to estimate summary hazard ratios and 95% CIs. There were 38 723 patients from 4 trials, with a mean 2.9 years of follow-up. Of the patients, 22 870 (59%) had cardiovascular disease, 7754 (20%) had reduced kidney function, and 4543 (12%) had heart failure. There were 3828 major adverse cardiac events. There was overall benefit for major adverse cardiac events (0.88; 95% CI, 0.82-0.94; <i>P</i><0.001) and no evidence that the effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibition varied across patient subgroups, defined by the presence of cardiovascular disease or heart failure at baseline (all <i>P</i> interaction >0.252; I<sup>2</sup><25%). All patient subgroups benefited with respect to hospitalization for heart failure (all <i>P</i> interaction>0.302; I<sup>2</sup><10%), cardiovascular death (all <i>P</i> interaction>0.167; I<sup>2</sup><50%), and death from any cause (all <i>P</i> interaction>0.354; I<sup>2</sup>=0%). The only difference in effects across subgroups was for stroke, with protection observed among those with reduced kidney function but not those with preserved kidney function (<i>P</i> interaction=0.020; I<sup>2</sup>=81%).

Over the years, significant progress has been made in identifying the risk factors for developing T2DM, understanding its pathophysiology and uncovering various metabolic pathways implicated in the disease process. This has culminated in the implementation of robust prevention programmes and the development of effective pharmacological agents, which have had a favourable impact on the management of T2DM in recent times. Despite these advances, the incidence and prevalence of T2DM continue to rise. Continuing research in improving efficacy, potency, delivery and reducing the adverse effect profile of currently available formulations is required to keep pace with this growing health challenge. Moreover, new metabolic pathways need to be targeted to produce novel pharmacotherapy to restore glucose homeostasis and address metabolic sequelae in patients with T2DM. We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar databases for recently included agents and novel medication under development for treatment of T2DM. We discuss the pathophysiology of T2DM and review how the emerging anti-diabetic agents target the metabolic pathways involved.

Retrospective cohort study comparing weight loss and metabolic outcomes between patients with and without type 2 diabetes, matched for body mass index (BMI), gender and age, 12 months after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Forty-eight patients with type 2 diabetes (D) and 48 without type 2 diabetes (ND) were evaluated, 87.5% female, mean age 42.2 ± 0.9 years. The mean baseline weight and BMI of the D and ND groups were, respectively, 120.3 ± 21.6 vs 123.7 ± 20.8 kg (P = .45) and 47.2 ± 7.5 vs 47.2 ± 6.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (P = .70). After 12 months, there was no significant difference in weight (40.4 ± 16.9 vs 44.1 ± 12.2 kg, P = .28) and BMI (15.8 ± 6.5 vs 16.9 ± 4.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup> , P = .26) variation between groups. The parameters that presented significant variation were (D vs ND): fasting blood glucose (41.6 ± 43.0 vs 12.7 ± 17.2 mg/dL, P < .01), HbA1c (1.8 ± 1.6 vs 0.6 ± 0.7%; P < .01), triglycerides (91.1 ± 100.4 vs 54.2 ± 43.8 mg/dL; P = .04), low-density lipoprotein (27.2 ± 41.5 vs 37.5 ± 24.2 mg/dL; P < .01) and gamma glutamyl transferase (46.5 ± 55.3 vs 17.7 ± 11.9 UI/L; P = .04).

However, the brain functional mechanism of T2DM-related dementia is still less understood. Recent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging functional connectivity (FC) studies have proved its potential value in the study of T2DM with cognitive impairment (T2DM-CI). However, they mainly used a mass-univariate statistical analysis that was not suitable to reveal the altered FC ""pattern"" in T2DM-CI, due to lower sensitivity. In this study, we proposed to use high-order FC to reveal the abnormal connectomics pattern in T2DM-CI with a multivariate, machine learning-based strategy. We also investigated whether such patterns were different between T2DM-CI and T2DM without cognitive impairment (T2DM-noCI) to better understand T2DM-induced cognitive impairment, on 23 T2DM-CI and 27 T2DM-noCI patients, as well as 50 healthy controls (HCs). We first built the large-scale high-order brain networks based on temporal synchronization of the dynamic FC time series among multiple brain region pairs and then used this information to classify the T2DM-CI (as well as T2DM-noCI) from the matched HC based on support vector machine. Our model achieved an accuracy of 79.17% in T2DM-CI versus HC differentiation, but only 59.62% in T2DM-noCI versus HC classification. We found abnormal high-order FC patterns in T2DM-CI compared to HC, which was different from that in T2DM-noCI. Our study indicates that there could be widespread connectivity alterations underlying the T2DM-induced cognitive impairment. The results help to better understand the changes in the central neural system due to T2DM."

T2D provokes unique metabolic changes and compromises cardiovascular geometry and function. Meanwhile, T2D increases the overall risk for heart failure (HF) and acts independent of classical risk factors including coronary artery disease, hypertension, and valvular heart diseases. The incidence of HF is extremely high in patients with T2D and is manifested as HF with preserved, reduced, and midrange ejection fraction (HFpEF, HFrEF, and HFmrEF, respectively), all of which significantly worsen the prognosis for T2D. HFpEF is seen in approximately half of the HF cases and is defined as a heterogenous syndrome with discrete phenotypes, particularly in close association with metabolic syndrome. Nonetheless, management of HFpEF in T2D remains unclear, largely due to the poorly defined pathophysiology behind HFpEF. Here, in this review, we will summarize findings from multiple preclinical and clinical studies as well as recent clinical trials, mainly focusing on the pathophysiology, potential mechanisms, and therapies of HFpEF in T2D."

AP is characterized by a complex mixture of components for which the composition depends on sources and metrological factors. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) monitors and regulates certain components of air pollution known to have negative consequences for human health. Research assessing the health effects of these components of AP often uses traditional regression models, which might not capture more complex and interdependent relationships. Machine learning has the capability to simultaneously assess multiple components and find complex, non-linear patterns that may not be apparent and could not be modeled by other techniques. Here we use k-means clustering to assess the patterns associating PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, CO, NO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, and SO<sub>2</sub> measurements and changes in annual diabetes incidence at a US county level. The average age adjusted annual decrease in diabetes incidence for the entire US populations is -0.25 per 1000 but the change shows a significant geographic variation (range: -17.2 to 5.30 per 1000). In this paper these variations were compared with the local daily AP concentrations of the pollutants listed above from 2005 to 2015, which were matched to the annual change in diabetes incidence for the following year. A total of 134,925 daily air quality observations were included in the cluster analysis, representing 125 US counties and the District of Columbia. K-means successfully clustered AP components and indicated an association between exposure to certain AP mixtures with lower decreases on T2D incidence."

We aim to investigate the role of the TyG index on cardiovascular (CV) events in type 2 diabetes mellitus and compare the roles of fasting glucose, hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub>, and the TyG index in predicting CV events. This retrospective study enrolled 3524 patients with type 2 diabetes from the Kaohsiung Medical University Research Database in 2009 in this longitudinal study and followed them until 2015. The TyG index was calculated as log (fasting triglyceride level (mg/dL) × fasting glucose level (mg/dL)/2). CV events included myocardial infarction, unstable angina, stroke, hospitalization for coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease, and CV-related death. The association between variables and CV events was assessed using a multivariable stepwise Cox proportional hazard analysis. Two hundred and fifteen CV events (6.1%) were recorded during a follow-up period of 5.93 years. The multivariable stepwise analysis showed that high fasting glucose (HR, 1.007; <i>p</i> < 0.001) and a high TyG index (HR, 1.521; <i>p</i> = 0.004) but not hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub> or triglycerides were associated with a higher rate of CV events.

It is crucial to clarify transcriptomics profiles and identify biomarkers related to the progression of T2DM complicated by CAPs. Ten human CAP samples were obtained, and whole transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed. Samples were divided into two groups: diabetes mellitus (DM) versus non-DM groups and unstable versus stable groups. The Limma package in R was used to identify lncRNAs, circRNAs, and mRNAs. Gene Ontology (GO) annotation and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network creation, and module generation were performed for differentially expressed mRNAs. Cytoscape was used to create a transcription factor (TF)-mRNA regulatory network, lncRNA/circRNA-mRNA co-expression network, and a competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network. The GSE118481 dataset and RT-qPCR were used to verify potential mRNAs.The regulatory network was constructed based on the verified core genes and the relationships were extracted from the above network. In total, 180 differentially expressed lncRNAs, 343 circRNAs, and 1092 mRNAs were identified in the DM versus non-DM group; 240 differentially expressed lncRNAs, 390 circRNAs, and 677 mRNAs were identified in the unstable versus stable group. Five circRNAs, 14 lncRNAs, and 171 mRNAs that were common among all four groups changed in the same direction. GO/KEGG functional enrichment analysis showed that 171 mRNAs were mainly related to biological processes, such as immune responses, inflammatory responses, and cell adhesion. Five circRNAs, 14 lncRNAs, 46 miRNAs, and 54 mRNAs in the ceRNA network formed a regulatory relationship.

Methods and Results Pharmacy and medical claims data from within Anthem were queried for patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Using an index date of April 18, 2018, we evaluated the proportion of patients with a prescription claim for any of the 3 evidence-based therapies on, or covering, the index date ±30 days: high-intensity statin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker, and sodium glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor or glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist. The potential benefit of achieving 100% adoption of all 3 evidence-based therapies was simulated using pooled treatment estimates from clinical trials. Of the 155 958 patients in the sample, 24.7% were using a high-intensity statin, 53.1% were using an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker, and 9.9% were using either an sodium glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor or glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists. Overall, only 2.7% of the population were covered by prescriptions for all 3 evidence-based therapies, and 37.4% were on none of them. Over a 12-month period, 70.6% of patients saw a cardiologist, while only 18% saw an endocrinologist. Increasing the use of evidence-based therapies to 100% over 3 years of treatment could be expected to reduce 4546 major atherosclerotic cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death) in eligible but untreated patients. Conclusions Alarming gaps exist in the contemporary use of evidence-based therapies in this large population of insured patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. These data provide a call to action for patients, providers, industry, regulators, professional societies, and payers to close these gaps in care."

T2DM is a multi-factorial disease including several environmental factors with the presence of genetic predisposition. The transcription factor GLI-Similar 3 (GLIS3) has an important role in the development, survival and proliferation of pancreatic beta-cells and insulin gene expression regulation. Accordingly, genome-wide association studies have shown that GLIS3 gene polymorphism may confer risk to type 2 diabetes mellitus T2DM. The present study intended to investigate the association between GLIS3 rs7020673 gene polymorphism and type 2 diabetes mellitus and its impact on glycemic control among Egyptian population. This study was conducted on 100 Egyptian patients diagnosed asT2DM patients and 100 age- and sex-matched non-diabetic normal controls. All subjects underwent full history taking, thorough clinical examination, routine laboratory investigations including fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting insulin and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). Detection of rs7020673 polymorphism of GLIS3 gene was done by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and verified by sanger sequencing. Genotype and allele frequencies of rs7020673 did not differ between case and control groups. Regarding the heterozygous mutant genotype (GC), it was statistically less frequently distributed in diabetic patients (53%) versus controls (67%). Therefore, it can be considered as a negative risk factor for T2DM (OR: 0.5098, 95% CI (0.2827-0.9193), (P< 0.05). In conclusion, our study indicated that the."

We aimed to study the association of RHR with rapid renal function decline (RRFD) and to explore whether the association of RHR with RRFD is modulated by arterial stiffness in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Approach and Results: One thousand one hundred forty-two Asian people with type 2 diabetes mellitus were followed for 3.9±0.9 years in a regional hospital and a primary care facility. RRFD was defined as eGFR decline of 5 mL/min per 1.73 m2 or greater per year. Arterial stiffness was assessed by carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity. One hundred sixty-eight participants (15%) were classified as having RRFD. Participants with elevated RHR were younger, had higher levels of HbA1c, albuminuria, C-reactive protein, and pulse wave velocity. Compared with the lowest quartile, participants in quartile 4 had a higher risk for RRFD after adjustment for known risk factors (adjusted odds ratio 1.91 [1.11-3.28]). RHR improved discrimination and net reclassification for prediction of RRFD above traditional risk factors. Remarkably, arterial stiffness modulated the association of RHR with RRFD (<i>P</i> for interaction =0.03). RHR was significantly associated with risk of RRFD only in those with increased arterial stiffness (pulse wave velocity above age-reference value 7.7 m/s)."

In this case-control study, we investigated the relationship between the -1082G/A, -819C/T, and -592C/A polymorphisms in interleukin 10 (IL-10) and the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus in a Chinese population. Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (N = 228) and control subjects (N = 240) were recruited from the Department of Endocrinology at the People's Hospital of Linyi City, between September 2013 and April 2015. The IL-10 -1082G/A, -819C/T, and -592C/A polymorphisms were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that patients carrying the AA genotype of IL-10 -592C/A were at a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus compared to those carrying the CC genotype [adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.74; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.03-2.95]. In addition, individuals carrying the A allele of IL-10 -592C/A showed a 1.34-fold higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus compared to those carrying the C allele (adjusted OR = 1.34; 95%CI = 1.03- 1.75). There was no significant correlation between the IL-10 -1082G/ A and -819C/T polymorphisms and risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

In this paper, we have evaluated B cell function and the metabolic requirements of B cell antibody responses in elderly T2DM patients (E<sub>T2DM</sub>) taking or not Metformin, and compared to those of healthy elderly (E<sub>H</sub>) and healthy young (Y<sub>H</sub>) individuals. Results show that Metformin significantly increases <i>in vivo</i> B cell function, measured by influenza vaccine-specific serum antibodies, in E<sub>T2DM</sub> patients to the levels observed in E<sub>H</sub> and more importantly in Y<sub>H</sub> individuals. Metformin also decreases the frequencies of pro-inflammatory B cell subsets, as well as intrinsic inflammation and metabolic requirements of peripheral B cells from E<sub>T2DM</sub>. This hyper-metabolic phenotype of B cells from E<sub>T2DM</sub> is needed to support intrinsic inflammation, measured by the expression of transcripts for markers of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), and the secretion of autoimmune antibodies. Importantly, B cell function in E<sub>T2DM</sub> patients taking Metformin is not only increased as compared to that in E<sub>T2DM</sub> patients not taking Metformin, but is comparable to B cell function measured in Y<sub>H</sub> individuals. These results altogether strongly support the anti-aging effects of Metformin on humoral immunity."

PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and Scopus were searched systematically until October 18, 2021. Thirty-four RCTs with 2154 patients met our inclusion. Pooled analysis indicated that Zingiberaceae can significantly improve body weight (BW) (WMD = -1.012, 95% CI: -1.673, -0.351, p = .003), fasting blood glucose (FBG) (WMD = -14.292, 95% CI: -18.588, -9.995, p < .001), glycosylated hemoglobin 1c (HbA1c) (WMD = -0.432, 95% CI: -0.607, -0.257, p < .001), serum insulin (WMD = -2.036, 95% CI: -2.857, -1.216, p < .001), homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (WMD = -0.886, 95% CI: -1.375, -0.398, p < .001), high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) (WMD = 0.850, 95% CI: 0.018, 1.682, p = .045), triglyceride (TG) (WMD = -17.636, 95% CI: -27.121, -8.151, p < .001), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (WMD = -0.642, 95% CI: -1.148, -0.137, p = .013), C-reactive protein (CRP) (WMD = -0.623, 95% CI: -1.061, -0.186, p = .005), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) (WMD = -3.020, 95% CI: -4.327, -1.712, p < .001), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) (WMD = -1.147, 95% CI: -1.887, -0.406, p = .002). The supplementation of Zingiberaceae may be an effective adjunctive therapy in management of T2DM and prevention cardiovascular complications by decreasing BW, improving blood glucose control, insulin resistance, lipid profiles (HDL-C and TG), blood pressure (DBP), and reducing inflammation (CRP, TNF-α, and IL-6). PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Approximately half of the deaths of individuals with diabetes mellitus (DM) are attributable to cardiovascular disease (CVD), and individuals with T2DM have a two-fold increased risk of cardiovascular mortality than healthy individuals. Currently, T2DM is mainly treated with hypoglycemic medication such as sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, meglitinides, and biguanides. Nevertheless, most of them with long-term usage could cause side effects, including hypoglycemia and gastrointestinal troubles. Several species of the Zingiberaceae family are used in traditional herbal medicines, which have been widely used in traditional and complementary medicine. Proving the potential benefits of Zingiberaceae on T2DM and its cardiovascular complications has positive clinical implications for the use of this practical herb."

We aimed to examine the effect of glycemic status evaluated by hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) on the risk of thromboembolism among patients with atrial fibrillation and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Methods In this cohort study, we used data from Danish registries to identify patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and incident nonvalvular atrial fibrillation in the period of May 1, 2005, through December 31, 2015. On the basis of the most recent HbA1c measurement before an incident atrial fibrillation diagnosis, patients were divided into the categories: HbA1c ≤48 mmol/mol, HbA1c=49-58 mmol/mol, and HbA1c >58 mmol/mol. Cox regression analysis was used to estimate hazard ratios for the outcome thromboembolism. Results The study population included 5386 patients with incident nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Compared with patients with HbA1c ≤48 mmol/mol, we observed a higher risk of thromboembolism among patients with HbA1c=49-58 mmol/mol (hazard ratio, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.09-2.05) and HbA1c >58 mmol/mol (hazard ratio, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.13-2.22) after adjusting for confounding factors. When stratified on diabetes mellitus duration, similar results were found among patients with diabetes mellitus duration of <10 years. Contrastingly, in patients with diabetes mellitus duration of ≥10 years, higher HbA1c levels were not associated with a higher risk of thromboembolism. Conclusions In patients with incident atrial fibrillation and type 2 diabetes mellitus, increasing levels of HbA1c were associated with a higher risk of thromboembolism. However, no association was found among patients with diabetes mellitus duration ≥10 years."

We then randomly selected 20% of these reviews in each year, and performed methodological and reporting quality assessment using the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Review 2 (AMSTAR-2) checklist and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement. We also conducted regression analyses to explore the association between characteristics of systematic reviews and AMSTAR-2 or PRISMA scores. <b>Results:</b> A total of 238 systematic reviews, including 33 registered and 205 non-registered articles, met the inclusion criteria and were subsequently reviewed. Analysis indicated an increase in both registered rates and quality of systematic reviews in type 2 diabetes mellitus over the recent years. With regards to methodological and reporting quality, we found higher scores in registered, relative to non-registered reviews (AMSTAR-2 mean score: 18.0 vs. 14.5, <i>P</i> = 0.000; PRISMA mean score: 20.4 vs. 17.6, <i>P</i> = 0.000). AMSTAR-2 and PRISMA scores were associated with registration status, country of the first author, and statistical results, whereas the proportion of discussing publication bias and reporting funding sources were <40% for both registered and non-registered systematic reviews. <b>Conclusions:</b> Methodological and reporting quality of systematic reviews in type 2 diabetes mellitus indicates an improvement in the recent years. However, the overall quality remains low, necessitating further improvement. Future studies are expected to pay more attention to prospective registration, description of publication bias and reporting of funding sources."

This study attempted to investigate this association in the middle-aged and elderly Chinese population and analyze the joint effects of Hp infection and some risk factors on T2DM. Following a cross-sectional design, participants were recruited from the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University in Hefei City, China. Hp status was measured using a <sup>14</sup>C urea breath test. A total of 1,288 participants, including 90 diabetic patients and 1,198 nondiabetic subjects, were recruited in the current study. The participants with T2DM had a greater prevalence of Hp infection than participants without T2DM (26.67% versus 18.11%, p = 0.045). Furthermore, we found that Hp infection was closely associated with an incremental risk of T2DM [odds ratio (OR) = 1.77, 95% confidence intervals (CI): 1.04-3.00] after adjustment for potential confounders. In addition, we observed that the participants who were Hp-positive and ≥60 years old (OR = 9.16, 95% CI: 3.29-25.52), Hp-positive and obese (OR = 3.35, 95% CI: 1.57-7.14) or Hp-positive and hypertensive (OR = 6.10, 95% CI: 3.10-12.01) had a significantly higher risk for T2DM than those who were Hp-negative and ≤50 years old, Hp-negative and nonobese or Hp-negative and nonhypertensive. These findings imply that Hp infection is associated with an increased risk of T2DM in the middle-aged and elderly Chinese population. The association could be further elevated by the combination of Hp infection and some traditional risk factors."

Atherosclerosis is an aggravating factor for peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Our study intended to study the association between PAD and serum A-FABP levels in type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients. One hundred and twenty T2DM subjects were enrolled in the study. Fasting blood samples were collected to determine biochemical data and A-FABP levels. By the automatic oscillometric method, the ankle-brachial index (ABI) was measured. Low ABI was defined as any value &lt; 0.9. Twenty participants with T2DM (16.7%) were included in the low ABI group. Low ABI T2DM participants had an increased mean body mass index, body fat mass, systolic blood pressure, C-reactive protein, urine albumin-creatinine ratio, and A-FABP levels compared to those in the normal ABI group. After variables significantly associated with PAD were adjusted by multivariate logistic regression analyses, circulating A-FABP levels (odds ratio [OR]: 1.138; 95 percent confidence interval [CI]: 1.023-1.266; <i>p</i> = 0.017) were identified as the independent marker of PAD.

Di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP), a widely used plasticizer, could exacerbate type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The study aimed to investigate the metabolic toxicity, susceptibility and mechanism of DEHP exposure to A-T2DM. DEHP was administered orally (0, 0.18, 1.8, 18, and 180 mg/kg/day) for 3 weeks to adolescent normal mice (A-normal mice) and established A-T2DM mice. The results of fasting blood glucose (FBG) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels showed that the susceptibility of A-T2DM mice to DEHP exposure was more significant than that of A-normal mice. DEHP, interfering with glucose and lipid metabolism of A-normal and A-T2DM mice, caused the body weight increase of A-normal mice and decrease of A-T2DM mice. Besides, DEHP could cause more injury of cardiovascular, hepatic and renal function to A-T2DM mice than A-normal mice. Hepatic transcriptome analysis revealed that DEHP exposure interfered with the biological feedback adjustment of endocrine and metabolic system in A-T2DM mice and then led to the development of T2DM. According to the transcriptome results, insulin signaling transduction pathway was applied and researched by immunoassay. It was discovered that DEHP reduced insulin sensitivity and disturbed insulin signaling transduction, glucose utilization, lipid synthesis and protein synthesis. Collectively, DEHP could disturb the endocrine and metabolic functions and increase the insulin resistance in adolescent mice. Moreover, the adolescent T2DM mice are more sensitive to DEHP-induced endocrine and metabolic toxicity than the healthy adolescent mice."

The values of area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and accuracy of our predictive model were calculated. Eleven out of the 193 food intake variables were selected for inclusion in our model, which yielded a value of area under the ROC curve of 0⋅79 and a maximum PPV, NPV and accuracy of 0⋅37, 0⋅98 and 0⋅91, respectively.

Soya isoflavones act as antidiabetic agents and protect against NAFLD. There are data suggesting that inulin may increase the plasma concentration and effect of soya isoflavones. The aim of the present study was to compare the effect of soya isoflavones, as opposed to the effect of soya isoflavones with inulin, on plasma lipid profile, liver morphology, and liver fatty acids in rats with induced type-2 diabetes mellitus. Data were collected on thirty-six male Sprague-Dawley rats divided into control and diabetic groups. Animals in the diabetic (DM) group were on a high-fat diet and were injected with low doses of streptozotocin. Animals in the control groups were fed a regular diet and were injected with a buffer. After the injections, the animals were divided into three groups of nondiabetic rats (nDM)-controls (c-nDM), rats treated with isoflavones (IS-nDM), and rats treated with isoflavones plus inulin (IS+IN-nDM)-and three parallel diabetic (DM) subgroups: controls (c-DM), rats treated with isoflavone (IS-DM), and rats treated with isoflavones plus inulin (IS+IN-DM). Hepatic steatosis and fibrosis were examined using hematoxylin-eosin staining and Mallory's trichrome methods respectively. Liver fatty acids were extracted and analyzed by gas chromatography. A lipid blood test was performed. The study showed significant changes in liver fatty acids, liver morphology, and plasma lipid profile. The estimated SCD-18 index significantly decreased in both the control and DM groups after isoflavone supplementation. The level of liver steatosis and fibrosis also decreased after isoflavone supplementation in the DM groups. The plasma lipid profile showed increased levels of HDL-C after isoflavone supplementation in the DM groups. These results support the protective use of isoflavones in liver steatosis and as beneficial to plasma lipid profile in individuals with diabetes. A novelty of this work is its comparison of supplementation using soya isoflavones with supplementation using both soya isoflavones and inulin. Surprisingly, additional supplementation with inulin modulates the positive effect of isoflavones."

Zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8), a novel islet autoantigen, is specifically expressed in insulin-containing secretory granules of β-cells. Genetic studies show that the genotypes of SLC30A8 can determine either protective or diabetogenic response depending on environmental and lifestyle factors. The ZnT8 protein expression, as well as zinc content in β-cells, was decreased in diabetic mice. Thus, ZnT8 might participate in insulin biosynthesis and release, and subsequently involved deteriorated β-cell function through direct or indirect mechanisms in type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus. From a clinical feature standpoint, the prevalence of ZnT8A is gradiently increased in type 2 diabetes mellitus, latent autoimmune diabetes in adults and type 1 diabetes mellitus. The frequency and epitopes of ZnT8-specific T cells and cytokine release by ZnT8-specific T cells are also different in diabetic patients and healthy controls. Additionally, the response to ZnT8 administration is also different in type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

The risk factors for T2DM include both genetic and lifestyle factors. Genome‑wide association studies have indicated the association of genetic variations with many diseases, including T2DM. Glucokinase (GCK) plays a key role in the regulation of insulin release in the pancreas and catalyzes the first step in glycolysis in the liver. Genetic alterations in the <i>GCK</i> gene have been implicated in both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia. MicroRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) are small non‑coding RNA molecules that are involved in the important physiological processes including glucose metabolism. In the present study, the association of the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the <i>GCK</i>, <i>MIR‑196A‑2</i> and <i>MIR‑423</i> genes with susceptibility to T2DM in patients from two regions of Saudi Arabia were examined, using the tetra‑primer amplification refractory mutation system. The results showed that the AA genotype and the A allele of GCK rs1799884 were associated with T2DM [odds ratio (OR)=2.25, P=0.032 and OR=1.55, P=0.021, respectively]. Likewise, the CT genotype and T allele of <i>MIR‑196A‑2</i> rs11614913 were associated with an increased risk of T2DM (OR=2.36, P=0.0059 and OR=1.74, P=0.023, respectively). In addition, the CA genotype of <i>MIR‑423</i> rs6505162 C>A was found to be linked with T2DM (OR=2.12 and P=0.021). It was concluded in the present research study that gene variations in <i>GCK</i>, <i>MIR‑196A‑2</i> and <i>MIR‑423</i> are potentially associated with an increased risk of T2DM. These results, in the future, may help in the identification and stratification of individuals susceptible to T2DM.

Odds ratio (OR) and standard mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. Twenty-five articles were meta-analysed, with 20 articles for T2DM risk and 9 articles for circulating IL-6 changes. Overall, there was no detectable significance for the association between -174G/C polymorphism and T2DM, and this association was relatively obvious under dominant model (OR: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.56-1.21). Improved heterogeneity was seen in some subgroups, with statistical significance found in studies involving subjects of mixed races (OR: 0.63, 95% CI: 0.46-0.86). Begg's and filled funnel plots, along with Egger's tests revealed week evidence of publication bias.

Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, placenta growth factor (PlGF)-1 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)A play important roles in atherogenesis and arteriogenesis. VEGF-receptor (VEGFR)-mediated monocyte migration is inhibited in T2DM (VEGFA resistance), while TGF-β1-induced monocyte migration is fully functional. Therefore, we hypothesize that TGF-β antagonises the VEGFA responses in human monocytes. We demonstrate that monocytes from T2DM patients have an increased migratory response towards low concentrations of TGF-β1, while PlGF-1/VEGFA responses are mitigated. Mechanistically, this is due to increased expression of type II TGF-β receptor in monocytes under high-glucose conditions and increased expression of soluble (s)VEGFR1, which is known to interfere with VEGFA signalling. VEGFA resistance in monocytes from T2DM patients can be rescued by either experimental down-regulation of TGF-β receptor expression in vitro or by functional blocking of TGF-β signalling using either a TGF-β receptor kinase inhibitor or a TGF-β neutralizing antibody. Our data demonstrate that both T2DM and high-glucose potentiate the TGF-β pathway. TGF-β signalling impairs VEGFR-mediated responses in T2DM monocytes and in this way contributes to mononuclear cell dysfunction, provide novel insights into T2DM vascular dysfunction."

Development of efficient treatments to treat the underlying chronic inflammation in obesity-associated T2DM, is an unmet medical need. To this end, we have developed a plasmid adiponectin (pADN) based nanomedicine for the treatment of insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Adiponectin is a potent anti-inflammatory/anti-diabetic adipokine, which is downregulated in obesity. In this study, nanomicelles comprising chitosan conjugated to oleic acid and adipose homing peptide (AHP) were developed to deliver pADN to adipocytes. Cationic chitosan-oleic-AHP micelles were 112 nm in size, encapsulated 93% of pADN and protected gene cargo from DNase I mediated enzymatic degradation. In vitro, the nanomicellar formulation significantly increased adiponectin production compared to free plasmid as well as standard transfecting agent FuGENE®HD. Single dose subcutaneous administration of pADN-chitosan-oleic-AHP to obese-diabetic rats, resulted in improved insulin sensitivity for up to 6 weeks, which matched the glucose disposal ability of healthy rats. Serum adiponectin level in pADN-chitosan-oleic-AHP treated rats was comparable to healthy rats for up to 3 weeks post treatment. Overall, the results indicate that pADN-chitosan-oleic-AHP based therapy is a promising treatment approach for obesity-associated T2DM."

We aimed to systematically evaluate the effects of probiotics on cardiometabolic parameters in type 2 diabetes based on randomized controlled studies. MEDLINE, Embase, and CENTRAL databases were reviewed to search for randomized controlled trials that examined the effects of probiotic supplementation on cardiometabolic parameters in patients with type 2 diabetes. 32 trials provided results suitable to be included in the analysis. The effects of probiotics were calculated for the following parameters: BMI, total cholesterol levels, LDL, triglycerides, HDL, CRP, HbA1c levels, fasting plasma glucose, fasting insulin levels, systolic and diastolic blood pressure values. Data analysis showed a significant effect of probiotics on reducing total cholesterol, triglyceride levels, CRP, HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose, fasting insulin levels, and both systolic and diastolic blood pressure values. Supplementation with probiotics increased HDL levels however did not have a significant effect on BMI or LDL levels. Our data clearly suggest that probiotics could be a supplementary therapeutic approach in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients to improve dyslipidemia and to promote better metabolic control.

High prevalence of cardiometabolic risk factors, lack of awareness among patients and physicians, deficient infrastructure, and economic constraints lead to a cascade of CRCs at a significantly earlier age in MENA and AFR. In this review, we present consensus recommendations by experts in MENA and AFR, highlighting region-specific challenges and potential solutions for management of CRCs. Health professionals who understand sociocultural barriers can significantly increase patient awareness and encourage health-seeking behavior through simple educational tools. Increasing physician knowledge on early identification of CRCs and personalized treatment based on risk stratification, alongside optimum glycemic control, can mitigate therapeutic inertia. Early diagnosis of high-risk people with regular and systematic monitoring of cardiorenal parameters, development of region-specific care pathways for timely referral to specialists, followed by guideline-recommended care with novel antidiabetics are imperative. Adherence to guideline-recommended care can catalyze utilization of sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists with demonstrated cardiorenal benefits-thus paving the way for overcoming care gaps in a cost-effective manner. Leveraging digital technology like electronic medical records can help generate real-world data and provide insights on voids in adoption of newer antidiabetic medications. A patient-centric approach, collaborative care among physicians from different specialties, alongside involvement of policy makers are key for improving patient outcomes and quality of care in MENA and AFR."

A model with clinical variables and biomarkers allowed for risk prediction for expanded HF outcomes (C-statistic=0.72). Discrimination results were similar for cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization. Conclusions Among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus after recent acute coronary syndrome, the use biomarkers such as N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide and clinical variables enables risk stratification for expanded HF outcomes.

35457752,Biopsychosocial and Nutritional Factors of Depression among Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients: A Systematic Review.,['Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus'],"['Norizzati Amsah', 'Zaleha Md Isa', 'Norfazilah Ahmad']","The rising prevalence of depression among Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) patients has triggered an alarming situation, and further actions need to be taken by health care professionals and policymakers to curb the issue. There is a lack of evidence review in terms of the biopsychosocial and nutritional factors that are related to depression among T2DM. Hence, this review aimed to identify available evidence on the biopsychosocial and nutritional factors associated with depression among T2DM patients based on the existing literature. Articles were systematically searched from four databases, namely PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and EBSCOHost. The approach for the identification of the final articles followed PRISMA guidelines. The selected full-text articles were published between 2017 and 2021 in the English language, and included studies focused on depression among T2DM patients. Using AXIS tools, the eligible articles were evaluated to assess the quality of studies. A total of 19 studies were included in the review, and information related to research questions and associated factors was extracted. Biological, psychological, social, and nutritional factors were shown to be linked with depression among T2DM patients. Future studies need to considered using the biopsychosocial model and incorporating nutritional factors to manage the issues of depression among T2DM patients."

This study intended to explore the function of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) in T2DM-PTB and the molecules involved. Mice were treated with streptozotocin to induce T2DM and then infected with Mtb. The mice with T2DM had increased weight, blood glucose level, glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, and increased susceptibility to PTB after Mtb infection. PTEN was significantly downregulated in mice with T2DM-PTB and it had specific predictive value in patients. Overexpression of PTEN improved mouse survival and reduced bacterial load, inflammatory infiltration, cell apoptosis, and fibrosis in lung tissues. Sp1 transcription factor (SP1) was predicted and identified as an upstream regulator of PTEN. SP1 suppressed PTEN transcription. Silencing of SP1 enhanced mouse survival and alleviated the lung injury, and it promoted the M1 polarization of macrophages in murine lung tissues. However, further downregulation of PTEN increased protein kinase B (Akt) phosphorylation and blocked the alleviating roles of SP1 silencing in T2DM-PTB. This study demonstrates that SP1 represses PTEN transcription to promote lung injury in mice with T2DM-PTB through Akt activation."

However, the exact role of these myokines in humans has not been fully established. Our aim was to evaluate the relationship between serum levels of myostatin and irisin in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients and non-diabetic controls and to explore its links with metabolic parameters. Case-control study including 73 type 2 diabetes mellitus patients and 55 non-diabetic subjects as control group. Circulating myostatin and irisin levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Type 2 diabetes mellitus patients showed significantly lower myostatin levels (p = 0.001) and higher irisin levels (p = 0.036) than controls. An inverse relationship was observed between myostatin and irisin levels (p = 0.002). Moreover, in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients, after adjusting by confounder factors, myostatin was negatively related to fasting plasma glucose (p = 0.005) and to triglyceride levels (p = 0.028) while irisin showed a positive association with these variables (p = 0.017 and p = 0.006 respectively). A linear regression analysis showed that irisin and fasting plasma glucose levels were independently associated to myostatin levels and that myostatin and triglyceride levels were independently associated to irisin concentrations in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. Our results suggest that serum levels of myostatin and irisin are related in patients with type 2 diabetes. Triglyceride and glucose levels could modulate myostatin and irisin concentrations as a compensatory mechanism to improve the metabolic state in these patients although further studies are needed to elucidate whether the action of these myokines represents an adaptative response."

Exploring the causative alterations of T2DM within the nasal mucosa and NALT could provide insight into the pathogenic mechanisms and bridge the gap between innate immunity and adaptive immunity for virus clearance. Here, we designed a case-control study to compare the olfactory function (OF) among the groups of normal control (NC), COVID-19 mild pneumonia (MP), and MP patients with T2DM (MPT) after a 6-8 months' recovery, in which MPT had a higher risk of hyposmia than MP and NC. No significant difference was found between the MP and NC. This elevated risk of hyposmia indicated that T2DM increased COVID-19 susceptibility in the nasal cavity with unknown causations. Therefore, we used the T2DM animal model (db/db mice) to evaluate how T2DM increased COVID-19 associated susceptibilities in the nasal mucosa and lymphoid tissues. Db/db mice demonstratedupregulated microvasculature ACE2 expression and significant alterations in lymphocytes component of NALT.

Previous studies have found that excessive fat deposits in organs such as the liver and muscle can cause insulin resistance through lipotoxicity that affects β-cell function. The relationships between fat deposits in pancreatic tissue, the function of β-cells, the method of visceral fat evaluation and T2DM have been sought by researchers. This study aims to elucidate the role of pancreatic fat deposits in the development of T2DM using quantitative computed tomography (QCT), especially their effects on islet β-cell function. <b>Methods:</b> We examined 106 subjects at the onset of T2DM who had undergone abdominal QCT. Estimated pancreatic fat and liver fat were quantified using QCT and calculated. We analysed the correlations with Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) scores and other oral glucose tolerance test-derived parameters that reflect islet function. Furthermore, correlations of estimated pancreatic fat and liver fat with the area under the curve for insulin (AUC<sub>INS</sub>) and HOMA-IR were assessed with partial correlation analysis and demonstrated by scatter plots. <b>Results:</b> Associations were found between estimated liver fat and HOMA-IR, AUC<sub>INS</sub>, the modified β-cell function index (MBCI) and Homeostatic Model Assessment β (HOMA-β). However, no significant differences existed between estimated pancreas fat and those parameters. Similarly, after adjustment for sex, age and body mass index, only estimated liver fat was correlated with HOMA-IR and AUC<sub>INS</sub>. <b>Conclusions:</b> This study suggests no significant correlation between pancreatic fat deposition and β-cell dysfunction in the early stages of T2DM using QCT as a screening tool. The deposits of fat in the pancreas and the resulting lipotoxicity may play an important role in the late stage of islet cell function dysfunction as the course of T2DM progresses."

Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate the association of different levels of HDL cholesterol with stroke risk. Results- During a mean follow-up period of 3.0 years, 8496 patients developed stroke (8048 ischemic and 448 hemorrhagic). Multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios across levels of HDL at baseline (<30 [reference group], 30-39.9, 40-49.9, 50-59.9, 60-69.9, 70-79.9, and ≥80 mg/dL) were 1.00, 0.86, 0.77, 0.71, 0.71, 0.77, and 0.69 ( P<sub>trend</sub> <0.001) for total stroke, 1.00, 0.89, 0.82, 0.75, 0.78, 0.76, and 0.75 ( P<sub>trend</sub> <0.001) for ischemic stroke, and 1.00, 0.89, 0.69, 0.66, 0.47, and 0.94 ( P<sub>trend</sub> =0.021) for hemorrhagic stroke, respectively. When we used an updated mean value of HDL cholesterol, the inverse association of HDL cholesterol with stroke risk did not change. This inverse association was consistent among patients of different ages, races, sexes, body mass index, hemoglobin A1c levels, never and past or current smokers, and patients with and without using glucose-lowering, cholesterol-lowering, or antihypertensive agents.

Seventy-six diabetic participants (aged 20-65 years) randomly assigned to intervention (n = 38) and placebo (n = 38) groups. The intervention group received 30 g/day dried Z. vulgaris for 12 weeks. At the end of the study, there was a significant reduction in the percentage change of weight, body mass index [BMI], insulin, homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance [HOMA-IR], Apoprotein B100 [ApoB100], and high-sensitive c-reactive protein [hs-CRP] in the intervention group compared to the controls. Also, increased values of quantitative insulin check index [QUICKI] and Apoprotein A-I [ApoA-I] in Z. vulgaris group compared to the controls were observed. In conclusion, consumption of dried Z. vulgaris fruit could have beneficial effects on improving the glycemic control and reducing the cardiovascular risk factors in the diabetic patients.

We also tested the hypothesis that sodium glucose cotransporter type 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors reduce the risk of development of new-onset AF for non-ischemic DCM patients. We retrospectively studied 210 patients with non-ischemic DCM and sinus rhythm, mean age of 59.0 ± 16.7 years and left ventricular ejection fraction of 31.0 ± 8.2% (all < 45%). T2DM was identified in 60 patients (28.6%), and the remaining 150 patients (71.4%) were classified as non-T2DM patients. New-onset AF occurred in 21 patients (10.0%) over a median follow-up of 6.1 years. Kaplan-Meier curve analysis showed that non-ischemic DCM patients without T2DM experienced fewer occurrences of the development of new-onset AF compared with those with T2DM (log-rank p = 0.0003). Furthermore, global longitudinal strain in patients who showed development of new-onset AF was significantly lower than that in those whose sinus rhythm was preserved (6.4 ± 1.4% vs. 7.7 ± 2.2%, p = 0.01). Of the 60 non-ischemic DCM patients with T2DM, those treated with SGLT2 inhibitors experienced fewer occurrences of the development of new-onset AF than did those not treated with SGLT2 inhibitors (log-rank p = 0.040). T2DM is associated with the development of new-onset AF in non-ischemic DCM patients, and treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors can significantly reduce the development of new-onset AF. Our findings may thus offer a new insight into the management of non-ischemic DCM patients with T2DM."

32510127,DhHP-6 ameliorates hepatic oxidative stress and insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes mellitus through the PI3K/AKT and AMPK pathway.,['AMPK'],"['Kai Wang', 'Yuting Liang', 'Yu Su', 'Liping Wang']","Insulin resistance is one major features of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Deuterohemin-βAla-His-Thr-Val-Glu-Lys (DhHP-6), a novel microperoxidase mimetic designed and synthesized based on microperoxidase 11 (MP-11), can scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) in vivo. In our previous studies, we showed that oral DhHP-6 could reduce blood glucose and improve insulin resistance. To investigate the mechanisms of how DhHP-6 ameliorates oxidative stress and insulin resistance, we established T2DM mouse models and glucosamine-induced HepG2 cell insulin resistance models. The results suggested that DhHP-6 decreased blood glucose, increased antioxidant enzyme activity, and inhibited glycogen synthesis in T2DM mice. In addition, DhHP-6 improved insulin resistance by activating phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT, and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway in T2DM mice. Furthermore, DhHP-6 also activated PI3K/AKT and AMPK pathway in glucosamine-induced HepG2 cells. However, LY294002 did not completely inhibit AKT phosphorylation, and partially inhibited AMPK phosphorylation, whilst compound C only partially reduced AMPK phosphorylation, and also partially inhibited AKT phosphorylation, suggesting that AKT and AMPK interact to improve insulin resistance. Thus, these data suggest that DhHP-6 attenuates insulin resistance via the PI3K/AKT and AMPK pathway."

Contributing factors such as modern lifestyle, genetic predisposition, and gene environmental interactions have been postulated, but the pathogenesis remains unclear. In this study, we attempt to investigate the potential mechanisms and interventions underlying T2DM-induced cognitive deficits from the brain-gut axis perspective. A combined analysis of the brain transcriptome, plasma metabolome, and gut microbiota in db/db mice with cognitive decline was conducted. Transcriptome analysis identified 222 upregulated gene sets and 85 downregulated gene sets, mainly related to mitochondrial respiratory, glycolytic, and inflammation. In metabolomic analysis, a total of 75 significantly altered metabolites were identified, correlated with disturbances of glucose, lipid, bile acid, and steroid metabolism under disease state. Gut microbiota analysis suggested that the species abundance and diversity of db/db mice were significantly increased, with 23 significantly altered genus detected. Using the multi-omics integration, significant correlations among key genes (<i>n</i> = 33), metabolites (<i>n</i> = 41), and bacterial genera (<i>n</i> = 21) were identified. Our findings suggest that disturbed circulation and brain energy metabolism, especially mitochondrial-related disturbances, may contribute to cognitive impairment in db/db mice. This study provides novel insights into the functional interactions among the brain, circulating metabolites, and gut microbiota."

The sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor Dapagliflozin has been reported to regulate cholesterol levels in T2DM patients, but the underlying mechanisms have not been studied. In the present study, we initially established <i>in vivo</i> T2DM mice models, and our results showed that both free cholesterol (FC) and cholesteryl ester (CE) were accumulated, while the pro-proliferation associated genes were downregulated in T2DM mice liver tissues, which were reversed by Dapagliflozin co-treatment. Similarly, the mice primary hepatocytes were loaded with cholesterol to establish <i>in vitro</i> models, and we expectedly found that Dapagliflozin attenuated cholesterol-overloading induced cytotoxicity and cellular senescence in the hepatocytes. Then, we noticed that oxidative damages occurred in T2DM mice liver tissues and cholesterol treated hepatocytes, which could be suppressed by Dapagliflozin. Also, elimination of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) by N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) recovered cellular functions of hepatocytes <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Furthermore, the potential underlying mechanisms were uncovered, and our data suggested that Dapagliflozin activated the anti-oxidant Nrf2/HO-1 pathway in mice hepatocytes, and silencing of Nrf2 abrogated the protective effects of Dapagliflozin on cholesterol-overloaded hepatocytes. Collectively, we concluded that Dapagliflozin recovered cholesterol metabolism functions in T2DM mice liver via activating the anti-oxidant Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, and our data supported that Dapagliflozin was a potential therapeutic drug to eliminate cholesterol-induced cytotoxicity during T2DM pathogenesis."

35144052,The role of selenium in type-2 diabetes mellitus and its metabolic comorbidities.,['Diabetes'],"['Holger Steinbrenner', 'Leonidas H Duntas', 'Margaret P Rayman']","This review addresses the role of the essential trace element, selenium, in type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and its metabolic co-morbidities, i.e., metabolic syndrome, obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. We refer to the dietary requirements of selenium and the key physiological roles of selenoproteins. We explore the dysregulated fuel metabolism in T2DM and its co-morbidities, emphasizing the relevance of inflammation and oxidative stress. We describe the epidemiology of observational and experimental studies of selenium in diabetes and related conditions, explaining that the interaction between selenium status and glucose control is not limited to hyperglycemia but extends to hypoglycemia. We propose that the association between high plasma/serum selenium and T2DM/fasting plasma glucose observed in many cross-sectional studies may rely on the upregulation of hepatic selenoprotein-P biosynthesis in conditions of hyperglycemia and insulin resistance. While animal studies have revealed potential molecular mechanisms underlying adverse effects of severe selenium/selenoprotein excess and deficiency in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and β-cell dysfunction, their translational significance is rather limited. Importantly, dietary selenium supplementation does not appear to be a major causal factor for the development of T2DM in humans though we cannot currently exclude a small contribution of selenium on top of other risk factors, in particular if it is ingested at high (supranutritional) doses. Elevated selenium biomarkers that are often measured in T2DM patients are more likely to be a consequence, rather than a cause, of diabetes."

Then, GO enrichment analysis was performed to identify the significant functions and pathways of overlapping modules in the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) database. More than 75% of these overlapping genes were found to be consistent with the findings of previous studies. In the three diseases, we found that Sarcoglycan delta (SGCD) and Rho family GTPase 3 (RND3) were the overlapping genes and identified negative regulation of apoptotic process and negative regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter RNA as the two overlapping biological functions. CML and PCa were the most closely related, with 34 overlapping genes, five overlapping modules, 27 overlapping biological functions, and nine overlapping pathways. There were 13 overlapping genes, one overlapping modules, four overlapping biological functions and one overlapping pathway (FoxO signaling pathway) were found in T2DM and CML.And T2DM and PCa were the least related pair in our study, with only six overlapping genes, five overlapping modules, and one overlapping biological function. SGCD and RND3 were the main gene-to-gene relationship among T2DM, CML, and PCa; apoptosis, development, and transcription from RNA polymerase II promote processes were the main functional connections among T2DM, CML, and PCa by network enrichment analysis. There is a ""scalene"" relationship among T2DM, CML, and PCa at gene, pathway, biological process, and module levels: CML and PCa were the most closely related, the second were T2DM and PCa, and T2DM and PCa were the least related pair in our study.

Results Of the 245 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Hansen's disease who were on oral dapsone 100 mg/day as part of their treatment regimen, 49 patients had diabetes and were eligible for the study as per predetermined inclusion criteria. Of these, 35 subjects (71%) had an HbA1c discordantly lower than the corresponding mean plasma glucose levels. Patients with discordant HbA1c levels were more likely to be male and to have a higher RBC mean corpuscular volume (MCV). A greater reduction in HbA1c levels was seen during the initial 3 months of therapy of dapsone treatment. Limitations The small sample size and retrospective design were limitations of this study. Also, we did not analyze the role of methemoglobinemia or the utility of alternative measures of glycemic control in these patients.

Variation in thyroid hormone levels, even within the normal range, can trigger the onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), particularly in people with prediabetes. However, the available evidence is contradictory. The purpose of this review is to understand the pathological relationship between thyroid-related disorders and T2DM. T2DM in thyroid dysfunction is thought to be caused by altered gene expression of a group of genes, as well as physiological abnormalities that result in decreased glucose uptake increased, splanchnic glucose absorption, disposal in muscles, increased hepatic glucose output. Additionally, both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism can cause insulin resistance. Insulin resistance can develop in subclinical hypothyroidism as a result of a reduced rate of insulin-stimulated glucose transfer caused by a translocation of the glucose transporter type 2 (GLUT 2) gene. On the other hand, novel missense variations in (Thr92Ala) can cause insulin resistance. Furthermore insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia resulting from diabetes can cause culminate in goitrous transformation of the thyroid gland. Thyroid-related diseases and T2DM are closely linked. Type 2 diabetes can be exacerbated by thyroid disorders, and diabetes can worsen thyroid dysfunction. Insulin resistance has been found to play a crucial role in both T2DM and thyroid dysfunction. Therefore, failure to recognize inadequate thyroid hormone levels in diabetes and insulin resistance in both conditions can lead to poor management of patients."

Recent advances have identified the gut as a potential target of metformin. As patients with metabolic disorders exhibit dysbiosis, the gut microbiome has garnered interest as a potential target for metabolic disease. Henceforth, studies have focused on unraveling the relationship of metabolic disorders with the human gut microbiome. According to various metagenome studies, gut dysbiosis is evident in T2DM patients. Besides this, alterations in the gut microbiome were also observed in the metformin-treated T2DM patients compared to the non-treated T2DM patients. Thus, several studies on rodents have suggested potential mechanisms interacting with the gut microbiome, including regulation of glucose metabolism, an increase in short-chain fatty acids, strengthening intestinal permeability against lipopolysaccharides, modulating the immune response, and interaction with bile acids. Furthermore, human studies have demonstrated evidence substantiating the hypotheses based on rodent studies. This review discusses the current knowledge of how metformin modulates T2DM with respect to the gut microbiome and discusses the prospect of harnessing this mechanism in treating T2DM."

Interestingly, the gut microbiota plays an important role in the development of metabolic diseases, especially T2DM. In this review, we introduce the characteristics of the gut microbiota in T2DM population, T2DM animal models, and diabetic complications. In addition, we describe the molecular mechanisms linking host and the gut microbiota in T2DM, including the host molecules that induce gut microbiota dysbiosis, immune and inflammatory responses, and gut microbial metabolites involved in pathogenesis. These findings suggest that we can treat T2DM and its complications by remodeling the gut microbiota through interventions such as drugs, probiotics, prebiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and diets."

35185792,Genetically Predicted Causality of 28 Gut Microbiome Families and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Risk.,['Mendelian randomization'],"['Kun Xiang', 'Jing-Jing Zhang', 'Yuan-Yuan Xu', 'Xing Zhong', 'Jing Ni', 'Hai-Feng Pan']","Mounting evidence indicates that gut microbiome may be involved in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, there is no consensus on whether there is a causal link between gut microbiome and T2DM risk. In the present study, the Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was performed to investigate whether gut microbiome was causally linked to T2DM risk. The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were significantly related to exposure from published available genome-wide association study (GWAS) were selected as instrumental variables (IVs). The robust methods including inverse variance weighting (IVW), MR Egger, and weighted median were conducted to infer the causal links. Mendelian randomization pleiotropy residual sum and outlier (MR-PRESSO) and MR-Egger regression were used to test whether there was horizontal pleiotropy and identify outlier SNPs. The estimates of IVW suggested that <i>Streptococcaceae</i> (odds ratio (OR) = 1.17, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.04-1.31, <i>p</i> = 0.009) was associated with higher risk of T2DM in European population. In Asian population, the MR IVW estimates revealed that there was a causal link between <i>Acidaminococcaceae</i> and T2DM risk (OR = 1.17, 95% CI, 1.04-1.31, <i>p</i> = 0.008). There was no evidence of notable heterogeneity and horizontal pleiotropy. However, after false discovery rate (FDR) correction, the causal link between gut microbiome and T2DM was absent (FDR, <i>p</i> > 0.05). In summary, using genetic instruments, this study does not find evidence of association between the 28 gut microbiome families and T2DM risk. However, <i>Streptococcaceae</i> and <i>Acidaminococcaceae</i> may have a borderline positive correlation with T2DM risk."

We sought to determine the cardioprotective action of finerenone according to prior treatment with newer antidiabetics and glycemic status. We searched PubMed and Cochrane Library from inception to October 1, 2021 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effect of finerenone on major adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with T2DM. We set the primary endpoint as major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as the composite of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure. We finally included two RCTs in our quantitative synthesis. Compared to placebo, finerenone induced a 23% risk reduction for the composite cardiovascular endpoint, regardless of prior glycemia. We also showed that finerenone provided significant cardiovascular benefit for obese patients with T2DM compared to placebo, although this benefit was diminished for subjects with a body mass index lower than 30 kg/m2. Finally, the combination of finerenone with sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors or glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists did not produce a significant risk reduction for MACE. We conclude that finerenone provides significant cardiovascular benefits for patients with T2DM, especially for those who are obese, while glycemic status or treatment with newer antidiabetics at baseline does not affect the observed cardioprotective action."

The sodium-glucose co-transporters 2 (SGLT2) are mainly expressed in S1 and S2 segments of the proximal convoluted tubule in the kidneys. Clinical guidelines recommend their use especially in Type 2 Diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients with vascular complications and/or heart failure highlighting the importance of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) pleiotropic effects. Interestingly, cognitive decline is a widely recognized complication of T2DM and, in addition, to clarify its pathophysiology, there is an urgent need to understand how and if diabetes therapies can control diabetes-related cognitive dysfunction. At the time, although SGLT2 proteins are present in the Central Nervous System (CNS), the SGLT2i effects on cognitive impairments remain partly unknown. In pre-clinical studies, SGLT2i ameliorates cognitive dysfunction in obese and T2DM mice, reducing oxidative stress, neuroinflammation and improving neuronal plasticity and mitochondrial brain pathway. In addition, SGLT2i could bring back mTOR to a physiological state of activation, stopping neurodegenerative diseases' onset or progression. Instead, clinical studies on T2DM-related cognitive dysfunction treated by SGLT2i are much more limited. For these reasons, further studies are needed to better elucidate if SGLT2i therapy can affect T2DM-related cognitive decline. In this scenario, this review aims to summarize the state of knowledge on the role of SGLT2i in T2DM-related cognitive dysfunction and stimulate new clinical trials."

Drug combinations play a vital role in treating multiple complex diseases by providing increased efficacy and reduced toxicity. Here, we adopted a computational framework to discover potential drugs and drug pairs for T2DM. Firstly, we collected T2DM-associated genes and constructed the disease module for T2DM. Then, by quantifying the proximity between drugs and the disease module, we found out potential drugs. Based on the drug-induced gene expression profiles, we further performed Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) on these drugs and identified several potential candidates. In addition, through network-based separation, potential drug combinations for T2DM were predicted. Results from this study could provide insights for anti-T2DM drug discovery and rational drug use of existing agents. As a useful computational framework, our approach could also be applied in drug research for other complex diseases."

This research is to carry out experiments on the pathological changes in the P2Y12 receptor in type 2 diabetes mellitus complicated with chronic itching. Changes in body weight, fasting blood glucose (FBG), thermal hyperalgesia, cold hyperalgesia, spontaneous itching, and sciatic nerve conduction velocity were detected. The content of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the dorsal root ganglion was detected by chemical fluorescence. The expression of the P2Y12 receptor, NLRP3, ASC, interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and IL-18 was detected by Western blotting, real-time quantitative PCR, immunofluorescence double labelling, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Itching and pain behaviours of the mice in the type 2 diabetes mellitus + itch group were significantly increased, and the expression of P2Y12 and NLRP3 as well as the content of ROS increased, and these changes were significantly reversed by treatment with P2Y12 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) or P2Y12 antagonist ticagrelor. Upregulated P2Y12 receptor expression after the activation of satellite glial cells contributes to the increase in ROS content in vivo, followed by NLRP3 inflammasome activation, increased inflammatory cytokine release, and damage to peripheral nerves, which leads to chronic itching. Treatment with P2Y12 shRNA or ticagrelor can inhibit these pathological changes, thus improving itching behaviour. Development mechanism of diabetes mellitus complicated with chronic itching. Notes: The upregulation of P2Y12 receptor expression and the activation of SGCs lead to the increase of ROS content in vivo, followed by the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome, the increase of inflammatory cytokine release, the abnormal excitation of DRG neurons, and the damage of peripheral nerves, resulting in chronic itching. P2Y12 receptor-related inflammatory injury involves chronic itching in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Treatment with P2Y12 receptor shRNA or P2Y12 antagonist ticagrelor can inhibit these pathological changes and improve itching behaviour."

Current evidence suggests an association between intestinal flora and type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In this paper, we summarized the current research, determining whether intestinal flora may become a new method to treat T2DM, and providing a theoretical basis and literature references for the prevention of T2DM based on the regulation of intestinal flora. Method: we carried out a review based on 13 published clinical trials to determine the correlation between T2DM and intestinal flora, and between changes in clinical outcomes and in intestinal flora in the development of T2DM; to assess the pathological mechanisms; and to discuss the treatment of diabetes based on intestinal flora. Results: we found that intestinal flora is involved in the occurrence and development of T2DM. Several pathological mechanisms may be involved in the process, including improving the gut barrier, alleviating inflammation, increasing glucagon-like peptide (GLP) 1 and GLP 2, increasing the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and so on. Several measures based on intestinal flora, including exercise, food, specific diets, drugs and probiotics, would be used to treat and even prevent T2DM. Conclusions: high-quality studies are required to better understand the clinical effects of intestinal flora in T2DM."

The present study aimed at probing into the effect and potential mechanism of CAPE-pNO<sub>2</sub> in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) compared with CAPE on model animal. Diabetic model was established by feeding one month of high-fat-diet (HFD) before injection of 40 mg/kg streptozotocin (STZ) for five days, and the normal diet mice were set as control group. Model mice were treated by CAPE-pNO<sub>2</sub> for one month again, the levels of blood glucose, blood lipid and blood insulin significantly decreased. In addition, the myocardial enzymes (creatine Kinase and lactate dehydrogenase) and liver transaminase (aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase) activities decreased. Furthermore, CAPE-pNO<sub>2</sub> could alleviate pancreatic damage, myocardial injury and hepatic steatosis caused by diabetes mellitus, and significantly improved the islet mass, β cell survival and the hepatic glycogen content. Besides, CAPE-pNO<sub>2</sub> enhanced the expression of phosphorylation-AMP-activated protein kinas (p-AMPK) (Thr172), GLUT4, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPARα) and p-Akt (Ser473), and inhibited the expression of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) and p-JNK (Thr183/Tyr185) in liver. All of those effects are better than CAPE generally.

Therefore, we investigated the association between dietary patterns and T2DM while taking into account these differences. For 1287 participants of the population-based KORA FF4 study (Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg), we identified three metabolically-homogenous subgroups (metabotypes) using 16 clinical markers. Based on usual dietary intake data, two diet quality scores, the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) and the Alternate Healthy Eating Index (AHEI), were calculated. We explored the associations between T2DM and diet quality scores. Multi-variable adjusted models, including metabotype subgroup, were fitted. In addition, analyses stratified by metabotype were carried out. We found significant interaction effects between metabotype and both diet quality scores (<i>p</i> < 0.05). In the analysis stratified by metabotype, significant negative associations between T2DM and both diet quality scores were detected only in the metabolically-unfavorable homogenous subgroup (Odds Ratio (OR) = 0.62, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.39-0.90 for AHEI and OR = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.40-0.96 for MDS).

The aim of this study was therefore to evaluate the plasma levels of FABP3 at different stages of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). <b>Methods:</b> A total of 334 subjects with T2DM who enrolled in a disease management program were included in this study and stratified according to eGFR. Plasma FABP3 concentrations were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. <b>Results:</b> FABP3 levels increased in parallel with the eGFR level. Increasing concentrations of FABP3 were independently and significantly associated with eGFR stage G2-G4. Age- and sex-adjusted FABP3 levels were positively associated with uric acid, urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio, FABP1, FABP2, and fatty liver index, but negatively associated with eGFR and hemoglobin. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our results indicate that circulating FABP3 in patients with T2DM is associated with eGFR, which suggests that increased plasma FABP3 may be involved in the pathogenesis of CKD."

However, differences between the use of high-sugar diets (HSD) and high-fat diets (HFD) to affect fly physiology, as well as the influence on sex and age, have been seldom described. Thus, the aim of the present work was to investigate and compare the effects of HSD (30% sucrose) and HFD (15% coconut oil) on symptoms of metabolic dysfunction related to obesity and type-2 diabetes mellitus, including weight gain, survival, climbing ability, glucose and triglycerides accumulation and expression levels of <i>Drosophila</i> insulin-like peptides (dIlps). Female and male flies were subjected to HSD and HFD for 10, 20 and 30 days. The obtained results showed clear differences in the effects of both diets on survival, glucose and triglyceride accumulation and dIlps expression, being gender and age determinant. The present study also suggested that weight gain does not seem to be an appropriate parameter to define fly obesity, since other characteristics appear to be more meaningful in the development of obesity phenotypes. Taken together, the results demonstrate a key role for both diets, HSD and HFD, to induce an obese fly phenotype with associated diseases. However, further studies are needed to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms how both diets differently affect fly metabolism."

The genetic factors and their mechanisms, along with gene-gene and gene-environment interactions associated with CHD in T2D Asians, are yet to be explored. Therefore, the objectives of this paper were to review the current evidence of genetic factors for CHD, summarize the proposed mechanisms of these genes and how they may associate with CHD risk, and review the gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in T2D Asians with CHD. The genetic factors can be grouped according to their involvement in the energy and lipoprotein metabolism, vascular and endothelial pathology, antioxidation, cell cycle regulation, DNA damage repair, hormonal regulation of glucose metabolism, as well as cytoskeletal function and intracellular transport. Meanwhile, interactions between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from different genes, SNPs within a single gene, and genetic interaction with environmental factors including obesity, smoking habit, and hyperlipidemia could modify the gene's effect on the disease risk. Collectively, these factors illustrate the complexities of CHD in T2D, specifically among Asians."

However, there is insufficient evidence to establish the timeline of the vascular dysfunction in diabetes, specifically in relation to sex. Here, we determined whether mesenteric arterial function is altered in UC Davis Type-2 Diabetes Mellitus (UCD-T2DM) rats and if this occurs as early as the pre-diabetic stage of the disease. Specifically, we investigated whether vascular dysfunction differs between pre-diabetic or diabetic status and if this varies by sex. We measured the responses to endothelium-dependent and -independent vasorelaxant as well as vasoconstrictor agents and explored the potential mechanisms involved in sex-specific development of arterial dysfunction in UCD-T2DM rats. In addition, indices of insulin sensitivity were assessed. We report the reduced insulin sensitivity in pre-diabetic males and diabetic females. Vascular relaxation to acetylcholine was impaired to a greater extent in mesenteric artery from males in the pre-diabetic stage than in their female counterparts. In contrast, the arteries from females with diabetes exhibited a greater impairment to acetylcholine compared with diabetic males. Additionally, the sensitivity of mesenteric artery to contractile agents in females, but not in males, after the onset of diabetes was increased.

The present study aimed to determine the occurrence of microvascular complications, peripheral artery disease, and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), in 2 Lithuanian counties. <i>Materials and Methods</i><i>:</i> The data on residents aged ≥ 18 years, who were diagnosed for the first time in 2004 with uncomplicated T2DM, were obtained from the National Health Insurance Fund database. The occurrence of T2DM microvascular complications, peripheral artery disease, and mortality during the period from 2004 to 2016 were assessed by gender and age groups (<65 and ≥65 years). <i>Results</i><i>:</i> During the 13 years, 46.9% of the patients developed T2DM complications. More men than women developed at least 1 T2DM complication (50.8% vs. 44.8%, <i>p</i> = 0.035). The mean time for developing any T2DM complication was 9.2 years. The probability of occurrence of any complication was 0.07 in the second year and increased to 0.59 in the thirteenth year of living with diabetes. Within the 13 years, 38.2% of the patients died. More men (43.1%) than women (35.5%) died during the analysis period (<i>p</i> = 0.036). Mortality was higher among older patients (60.7%) than among younger patients (22.2%) (<i>p</i> < 0.001). <i>Conclusions</i><i>:</i> The results of this study provide a comprehensive picture of microvascular complications, peripheral artery disease, and mortality among patients with T2DM of two Lithuanian counties. Information about the occurrence of T2DM complications and mortality will assist further studies in estimating the burden of T2DM and in performing economic evaluations of T2DM prevention and treatment in Lithuania."

Among the hypothesized independent risk factors implicated in the pathogenetic basis of disease, periodontal infection has been proposed to promote an amplification of the magnitude of the advanced glycation end product (AGE)-mediated upregulation of cytokine synthesis and secretion. These findings suggest an interrelationship between periodontal disease and type 2 diabetes, describing poor metabolic control in subjects with periodontitis as compared to nondiabetic subjects and more severe periodontitis in subjects with T2DM as compared to a healthy population, with a significant positive correlation between periodontal inflammatory parameters and glycated hemoglobin level. Results from clinical trials show that periodontal treatment is able to improve glycemic control in subjects with diabetes. Many therapeutic strategies have been developed to improve periodontal conditions in conjunction with conventional treatment, among which ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) is of specific concern.

Study participants (n = 150) were divided into groups: (H) systemically and periodontal healthy (control group); (P) with periodontitis, but systemically healthy; (DL-P) with dyslipidemia and periodontitis; (T2DMwell-DL-P) well-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus with dyslipidemia and periodontitis; and (T2DMpoorly-DL-P) poorly-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus with dyslipidemia and periodontitis. We preprocessed the microarray data using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) strategy, followed by the RankProd method to identify candidates for DEGs. Furthermore, we performed functional enrichment analysis using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis. DEGs were submitted to pairwise comparisons, and selected DEGs were validated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Validated DEGs verified from T2DMpoorly-DL-P versus H were: TGFB1I1, VNN1, HLADRB4 and CXCL8; T2DMwell-DL-P versus H: FN1, BPTF and PDE3B; DL-P versus H: DAB2, CD47 and HLADRB4; P versus H: IGHDL-P, ITGB2 and HLADRB4. In conclusion, we identified that circulating lymphocytes and monocytes of individuals simultaneously affected by T2DM, dyslipidemia and periodontitis, showed an altered molecular profile mainly associated to inflammatory response, immune cell trafficking, and infectious disease pathways.

Nine studies counting a total of 3,924,272 participants were assessed in the systematic review and meta-analyses. By meta-analysis using no antibiotic exposure as the reference, antibiotic exposure has a higher risk for T2DM (OR=1.16; 95% CI, 1.10-1.22). Subgroup analyses suggested that the antibiotic exposure could significantly enhance the risk of T2DM in those whose age were more than 50 (OR=1.17; 95% CI, 1.08-1.25). Further stratified analysis indicated that the association was likely attributed to the chemical structure of antibiotics, but not to antibacterial type and mechanism of action.

According to classical view, the main function of WAT is to store excess energy in the form of triglycerides, while BAT is a thermogenic tissue that acts a pivotal part in maintaining the core body temperature. White adipocytes display high plasticity and can transdifferentiate into beige adipocytes which have many similar morphological and functional properties with brown adipocytes under the stimulations of exercise, cold exposure and other factors. This phenomenon is also known as 'browning of WAT'. In addition to transdifferentiation, beige adipocytes can also come from de novo differentiation from tissue-resident progenitors. Activating BAT and inducing browning of WAT can accelerate the intake of glycolipids and reduce the insulin secretion requirement, which may be a new strategy to improve glycolipids metabolism and insulin resistance of obese and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients. This review mainly discusses the significance of brown and beige adipose tissues in the treatment of obesity and T2DM, and focuses on the effect of the browning agent on obesity and T2DM, which provides a brand-new theoretical reference for the prevention and treatment of obesity and T2DM."

Increasing evidence has indicated changes in the gut microbiota composition or function in type 2 diabetic patients. An analysis of 'dysbiosis' enables the detection of alterations in the specific bacteria, clusters of bacteria, or bacterial functions associated with the occurrence of type 2 diabetes. These bacteria are involved predominantly in the control of inflammation and energy homeostasis. This review attempts to show that the gut microbiota are important factors for the occurrence of type 2 diabetes and are important for the treatment of gut microbiota dysbiosis through bariatric surgery, fecal microbiota transplantation, prebiotics, and probiotics."

We aimed to evaluate the prevalence, type, and cost of comorbidities occurring in older T2DM patients versus older non-T2DM patients, and the factors associated with high cost (HC) T2DM patients. <b>Methods:</b> Retrospective cohort study using information from the Campania Region healthcare database. People aged ≥65 years who received ≥2 prescriptions for antidiabetic drugs were identified as ""T2DM patients."" Comorbidities among T2DM and non-T2DM groups were assessed through the RxRiskV Index (modified version). T2DM individuals were classified according to the total cost distribution as HC or ""non-high cost."" Two sub-cohorts of HC T2DM patients were assessed: above 90th and 80th percentile of the total cost. Age- and sex-adjusted logistic regression models were created. <b>Results:</b> Among the T2DM cohort, concordant and discordant comorbidities occurred significantly more frequently than in the non-T2DM cohort. Total mean annual cost per T2DM patient due to comorbidities was €7,627 versus €4,401 per non-T2DM patient. Among T2DM patients identified as being above 90th and 80th percentiles of cost distribution, the total annual costs were >€19,577 and >€2,563, respectively. The hospitalization cost was higher for T2DM cases. Strongest predictors of being a HC T2DM patient were having ≥5 comorbidities and renal impairment. <b>Conclusion:</b> HC patients accrued >80% of the total comorbidities cost in older T2DM patients. Integrated care models, with holistic and patient-tailored foci, could achieve more effective T2DM care."

33269434,Association of resistin (rs3745367) and urotensin II (rs228648 and rs2890565) gene polymorphisms with risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus in Indian population.,['Gene polymorphism'],"['Vikas Kumar', 'Jaswinder Singh', 'Kiran Bala', 'Jasbir Singh']","Insulin resistance may become the most powerful predictor of future development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and a therapeutic target for the treatment of the same. Both Resistin, an adipose derived peptide hormone and Urotensin II a potent vasoconstrictor, are reported to be involved in the development of insulin resistance and T2DM but the results remain contradictory. Therefore, investigations were carried out to study the association of T2DM and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in Resistin (RETN) gene at rs3745367 (+ 299 G > A) and Urotensin II (UTS2) gene at rs228648 (+ 143 G > A) and rs2890565 (+ 3836 C > T) in a North Indian population. Method: The present case-control study, conducted from August 2017 to July 2020, involved 168 T2DM patients and 102 healthy controls. SNPs rs3745367, rs228648 and rs2890565 were amplified from genomic DNA in the studied samples by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using specific primers. The amplified products were genotyped by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) using particular restriction endonucleases. Clinical parameters viz. glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting blood glucose (FBG), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (CHL) and fasting insulin were determined by enzymatic methods. Result and conclusion: A statistically significant association between T2DM and RETN gene at SNP rs3745367 (p = 0.001) and UTS2 gene at SNP rs2890565 (p = 0.001) was observed. In RETN gene SNP rs3745367, insulin and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were found to be higher in GA + AA combined genotype than in GG genotype for T2DM subjects. Regression analysis revealed that SNP rs2890565 and HOMA-IR were independently associated with the risk of development of T2DM when three SNPs were taken as independent variable adjusted for clinical variables. Among four haplotypes, A/T was found associated with increased risk of T2DM as determined for rs228648 and rs2890565 of UTS2 gene. It can be concluded from these results that polymorphism at rs3745367 of RETN gene and at rs2890565 of UTS2 gene are associated with risk of T2DM in North Indian population."

Conditional on body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC), a higher serum PCB-153 concentration may be a marker of T2DM risk because it reflects other aspects of obesity that are related to T2DM risk and to PCB-153 clearance. To estimate the amount of residual confounding by other aspects of obesity, we performed a quantitative bias analysis on the results of a specific study. A physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model was developed to predict serum levels of PCB-153 for a simulated population. T2DM status was assigned to simulated subjects based on age, sex, BMI, WC, and visceral adipose tissue mass. The distributions of age, BMI, WC, and T2DM prevalence of the simulated population were tailored to closely match the target population. Analysis of the simulated data showed that a small part of the observed association appeared to be due to residual confounding. For example, the predicted odds ratio of T2DM that would have been obtained had the results been adjusted for visceral adipose tissue mass, for the ≥90th percentile of PCB-153 serum concentration, was 6.60 (95% CI 2.46-17.74), compared with an observed odds ratio of 7.13 (95% CI 2.65-19.13). Our results predict that the association between PCB-153 and risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus would not be substantially changed by additional adjustment for visceral adipose tissue mass in epidemiologic analyses. Confirmation of these predictions with longitudinal data would be reassuring."

In the meta-analysis, summary relative risks (RRs) of 23 articles were compiled with a random effects model, and a restricted cubic spline regression model was used to explore whether there is a nonlinear relationship between dairy intake and T2DM risk. This cross-sectional study used baseline data from 38,735 participants of the Henan Rural Cohort study and the association between dairy consumption and T2DM was analyzed by a logistic regression model. The meta-analysis revealed a borderline negative significant association between total dairy intake and risk of T2DM, the RR and 95% confidence interval (CI) was 0.94; (0.89, 1.00), and the risk was lowest at 270 g daily dairy intake. In the cross-sectional study, there were 3654 T2DM patients and 68.3 percent of the respondents had no dairy intake. The average intake of dairy in the total population was 12 g per day. Fully adjusted analyses suggested positive associations, with an odds ratio (OR) comparing the highest with the zero intake of 1.34 (95% CI: 1.22, 1.48) for all participants, which was unaffected by sex. Dairy intake in rural areas of Henan province is low, and we found, in the context of overall low dairy intake, that a high intake was positively associated with T2DM, which is inconsistent with the meta-analysis results suggesting that dairy has marginal protective effects against T2DM."

Data on T2DM was sourced from the New Zealand Virtual Diabetes Register (2016), and data on environmental variables sourced from the Ministry for Primary Industries and Territorial Authorities (2013-2016). Novel measures of the built environment using an enhanced two-step floating catchment area model were established using data on fast food outlets, takeaways, dairy/convenience stores, supermarkets and fruit/vegetable stores. Rates of T2DM per 1000 population and standardised morbidity ratios were computed and visualised for all urban areas. Getis Ord was used to assess spatial clustering, and Bayesian modelling was used to understand associations between T2DM and environmental variables. Results indicate that T2DM is influenced by demographic factors, spatially clustered and associated with accessibility to environmental exposures. Health-promoting resources, such as fruit/vegetable stores, were shown to have a consistently protective effect on T2DM while those considered detrimental to health showed varying, and largely insignificant, associations. This is the first study in New Zealand to spatially quantify the effects of multiple environmental exposures on population level T2DM for all urban areas using a geospatial approach. It has implications for both policy and future research efforts as a deeper knowledge of local environments forms a basis on which to better understand spatial associations between the built environment and health, as well as formulate policy directed toward environmental influences on chronic health conditions."

Methods A total of 372 subjects with type 2 diabetes who had been hospitalized for the amelioration of their glycemic control and/or education about diabetes in Kawasaki Medical School Hospital were included in this study. We evaluated the remnant β-cell function as the HOMA-%β using the computer software program HOMA2 and estimated the glycemic fluctuation with the glycoalbumin (GA)/hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) ratio. In addition, we divided the subjects into a relatively young group (<65 years old) (n=210) and an elderly group (≥65 years old) (n=162) and performed several analyses in each group. Results The GA/HbA1c ratio, GA and HbA1c were independent determinant factors for the HOMA-%β regardless of age. We obtained almost the same results even after excluding those subjects using insulin secretagogues. These data suggest that the glycemic fluctuation and glycemic control are associated with the remnant β-cell function in Japanese subjects with type 2 diabetes.

In the current study, we investigated the effects of ERα and ERβ on the cognition, neurogenesis and apoptosis in high-fat diet and streptozocin-induced diabetic mice. We found that ERα and/or ERβ activation using their agonists (0.5 mg/kg E2, PPT or DPN) ameliorate memory impairment in the Morris water maze and Y-maze tests, increase hippocampal neurogenesis and prevent hippocampal apoptotic responses. Importantly, treatment with the pharmacologic ERs agonists caused significant increases in the membrane ERα and ERβ expression and subsequent PI3K/Akt, CREB and BDNF activation in the hippocampus of type 2 diabetes mellitus mice. Our data indicate that ERα and ERβ are involved in the cognitive impairment in type 2 diabetes, and that activated ERs, such as application of ERs agonists, could be a novel and promising strategy for the treatment of diabetic cognitive impairment."

Most of them (~90%) belong to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), which is a common chronic metabolic disorder, and the number of cases has been reported to increase each year. Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rat provides a successful animal model to study the pathogenesis of T2DM. Although previous hepatic transcriptome studies revealed some novel genes associated with the occurrence and development of T2DM, there still lacks the comprehensive transcriptomic analysis for the liver tissues of ZDF rats. We performed comparative transcriptome analyses between the liver tissues of ZDF rats and healthy ZCL rats and also evaluated several clinical indices. We could identify 214 and 104 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and lncRNAs in ZDF rats, respectively. Pathway and biofunction analyses showed a synergistic effect between mRNAs and lncRNAs. By comprehensively analyzing transcriptomic data and clinical indices, we detected some typical features of T2DM in ZDF rats, such as upregulated metabolism (significant increased lipid absorption/transport/utilization, gluconeogenesis, and protein hydrolysis), increased inflammation, liver injury and increased endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. In addition, of the 214 DEGs, 114 were known and 100 were putative T2DM-related genes, most of which have been associated with substance metabolism (particularly degradation), inflammation, liver injury and ER stress biofunctions. Our study provides an important reference and improves understanding of molecular pathogenesis of obesity-associated T2DM. Our data can also be used to identify potential diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets, which should strengthen the prevention and treatment of T2DM."

This study aimed to investigate the effects of tocotrienol-rich vitamin E (Tocovid Suprabio<sup>TM</sup>) on nerve conduction parameters and serum biomarkers among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A total of 88 patients were randomized to receive 200 mg of Tocovid twice daily, or a matching placebo for 12 months. Fasting blood samples were collected for measurements of HbA1c, renal profile, lipid profile, and biomarkers. A nerve conduction study (NCS) was performed on all patients at baseline and subsequently at 2, 6, 12 months. Patients were reassessed after 6 months of washout. After 12 months of supplementation, patients in the Tocovid group exhibited highly significant improvements in conduction velocity (CV) of both median and sural sensory nerves as compared to those in the placebo group.

For sub-Saharan African populations, the contribution of dietary factors to the development of NAFLD in the etiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) remains to be clarified. We identified sex-specific dietary patterns (DPs) related to the FLI using reduced ranked regression (RRR) and evaluated the associations of these DPs with T2DM. This analysis used data from the RODAM, a multi-center cross-sectional study of Ghanaian populations living in Ghana and Europe. The daily intake frequencies of 30 food groups served as the predictor variables, while the FLI was the response variable. The odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for T2DM were calculated per one standard deviation increase in the DP score using logistic regression. In males, the DP score explained 9.9% of the variation in their food intake and 16.0% of the variation in the FLI. This DP was characterized by high intakes of poultry, whole-grain cereals, coffee and tea, condiments, and potatoes, and the chance of T2DM was 45% higher per 1 DP score-SD (Model 2). Our results indicate that the intake of modernized foods was associated with proxies of NAFLD, possibly underlying the metabolic pathways to developing T2DM."

We performed a <i>post-hoc</i> analysis of the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes study. The primary microvascular outcomes of the present study included chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression, retinopathy, and neuropathy. Cox proportional-hazards models were performed to evaluate the association of FMI with microvascular diseases. A discordant analysis was performed to compare the magnitude of associations of FMI, BMI, and WC with the risk of microvascular diseases. Our study included 10,251 T2DM participants with a median of 5 years (interquartile range, 4.2-5.7) of follow-up. A total of 6,184 participants developed CKD progression, 896 participants had retinopathy, and 3,213 participants developed neuropathy (Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument, >2.0). After the confounding factors were adjusted for, patients in the highest FMI quartile had a higher risk of CKD progression (HR: 1.26, 95%CI: 1.16-1.36) and neuropathy (HR: 1.93, 95% CI: 1.74-2.15), except for retinopathy (HR: 1.17, 95% CI: 0.96-1.43), than those in the lowest quartile. Discordant analyses found that FMI and WC are better in identifying individuals with obesity-related risk of neuropathy, compared with BMI; neither is better in identifying individuals with obesity-related risk of CKD progression and retinopathy. Obesity is associated with CKD progression and neuropathy in T2DM participants. Further randomized trials are needed to test whether obesity control can improve the outcomes of T2DM participants with CKD or neuropathy. FMI and WC are more useful in identifying obesity-related risk of neuropathy compared with BMI in T2DM patients."

However, dysbiosis of the gut microbiota and immune deficiency, as well as environmental changes, can destroy the host-microbial balance, leading to the occurrence of a variety of diseases, such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and obesity. Meanwhile, diseases can also affect gut microbiota, forming a vicious cycle. The role of the intestinal microbiota in different diseases have been proven by several studies; however, as a common target of PCOS and T2DM, there are few reports on the treatment of different diseases through the regulation of intestinal microbiota as the critical correlation. This review analyzed the common mechanisms of intestinal microbiota in PCOS and T2DM, including the dysbiosis of gut microbiota, endotoxemia, short-chain fatty acids, biotransformation of bile acids, and synthesis of amino acid in regulating insulin resistance, obesity, chronic inflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction. The possible therapeutic effects of probiotics and/or prebiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation, bariatric surgery, dietary intervention, drug treatment, and other treatments targeted at regulating intestinal microbiota were also elucidated."

Euthyroid women with polycystic ovary syndrome accompanied with insulin resistance have lesser deiodinase activities. Correspondingly, the serum insulin level in a fasted condition positively correlates with the FT3/FT4 ratio, and insulin depletion decreases the DIO2 activity in mice. Selected genetic variants in DIO1 are also associated with insulin resistance measures. Therefore, if insulin positively regulates DIO1 and DIO2, the FT3/FT4 ratio should decrease under impaired insulin action, and the casual insulin level and FT3/FT4 ratio should be negatively correlated. To evaluate this hypothesis, we conducted a single-center retrospective study between 2018 and 2021. All participants visited the selected hospitals monthly for type 2 diabetes mellitus treatment and casual plasma glucose and HbA1c level measurements. Furthermore, their casual serum insulin levels were measured annually. Meanwhile, we excluded patients treated with insulin injection. Ultimately, we evaluated 71 patients, which all exhibited euthyroid conditions. The FT3/FT4 ratio was independently associated with thyroid-stimulating hormone, casual plasma glucose, and casual insulin levels. In terms of the regression coefficients of the univariate linear regression analysis, the FT3/FT4 ratio negatively correlated with the casual serum insulin levels. Therefore, the risk of FT3/FT4 ratio underestimation should be considered when diagnosing Graves' disease, which is often accompanied with insulin resistance."

ELISAs were conducted to measure inflammatory-related factors in serum. Next, isolated cardiomyocytes were used in loss- and gain-of-function experiments, followed by MTT and flow cytometry assays, conducted to evaluate cell proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis. <b>Results:</b> Our results revealed an increase in the inflammatory response in T2DM rat models, accompanied by significantly increased expression of miR-216a-3p and TLR pathway-related genes. However, a decrease in the expression of IFN-α2 was observed. Moreover, the presence of an miR-216a-3p inhibitor and si-IFN-α2 increased the expression of TLR pathway-related genes and cell apoptosis, whereas cell proliferation was significantly decreased in the cardiomyocytes. <b>Conclusion:</b> We found that in T2DM, miR-216a-3p inhibited the proliferation and enhanced the apoptosis of cardiomyocytes and generated an inflammatory response through activation of the TLR pathway and targeting of IFN-α2."

The aim of the present study was to identify the risk factors in dietary habits and their relationship with T2DM in urban Myanmar residents. We conducted a case-control study recruiting 300 individuals aged 25-74 years living in the Yangon Region, consisting of 150 newly diagnosed cases attending a diabetes clinic, and 150 controls, who were community residents and free of diabetes. The case group had a significantly higher consumption of noodles, fish, beans, fermented food and pickles, dried food, topping seasonings, and non-dairy milk products than the control group, whereas they had a lower vegetable intake (more than three servings/day) and fruit intake (more than three servings/day) than the control group. Furthermore, the case group exhibited a higher frequency of some dietary behaviors than the control group, such as (1) having meals with family, (2) skipping breakfast, and (3) eating out. The final model showed that topping seasonings (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 11.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.08-40.90), more than three servings/day of vegetable intake (aOR 0.18, 95% CI 0.05-0.67), and having meals with family (aOR 2.23, 95% CI 1.05-4.71) were associated with diabetes. The study suggests that Myanmar's characteristic dietary culture of topping their meals with salty seasonings and sauces and eating multiple dishes together as a family are risk factors associated with T2DM. Our findings may contribute recommendations and opportunities for the primary prevention of T2DM in urban Myanmar."

We prospectively included 183 participants with T2DM aged 41 to 62 years (30 non-HF patients and 153 HF patients) and 25 healthy volunteers in the study and evaluated clinical data, hemodynamics and biomarkers (N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and irisin). Serum levels of irisin &lt; 8.30 ng/mL were found to be a better indicator of HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) than irisin ≥ 8.30 ng/mL, but the predictive cut-off point for NT-proBNP remained the same as for HF with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF). Serum levels of irisin &lt; 10.4 ng/mL significantly improved the predictive ability of NT-proBNP for HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). In conclusion, we found that decreased serum levels of irisin significantly predicted HFpEF, rather than HFmrEF and HFrEF, in T2DM patients. This finding may open a new approach to HF risk stratification in T2DM patients."

Recent studies confirmed the association of genes and different single nucleotide polymorphisms with T2DM occurrence and progress. This study was aimed to estimate the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene polymorphism in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus patients in Erbil city. The results showed that the Body mass index (BMI), Systolic blood pressure and Diastolic blood pressure were significantly higher in the diabetic group compared to the control group (P<0.05). In addition, the percent of Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), Fasting blood glucose (FBG), and Homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were significantly higher in the diabetic group compared to the control group (P<0.05). Among different parameters of lipid profile, only Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) was significantly higher in the diabetic group compared to the control group. It was found that FBG value was significantly higher in patients with GA and AA genotypes of BsmI compared with healthy controls. Patients with the GA genotype of BsmI had a higher value of triglyceride compared to healthy individuals. Patients with all ApaI genotypes had higher FBS values than controls. There were not observed any signi?cant associations among the BsmI and ApaI polymorphisms and the risk of T2DM. In conclusion, no evidence was found for the association between two VDR polymorphisms and T2DM patients in Erbil city."

To reduce this burden, several programmes for optimising the care for these diseases have been developed. In Germany, so-called disease management programmes (DMPs), which combine components of Disease Management and the Chronic Care Model, are applied. These DMPs have proven effective. Nevertheless, there are opportunities for improvement. Current DMPs rarely address self-management of the disease, make no use of peer support, and provide no special assistance for persons with low health literacy and/or low patient activation. The study protocol presented here is for the evaluation of a programme that addresses these possible shortcomings and can be combined with current German DMPs for T2DM and CHD. This programme consists of four components: 1) Meetings of peer support groups 2) Personalised telephone-based health coaching for patients with low literacy and/or low patient activation 3) Personalised patient feedback 4) A browser-based web portal METHODS: Study participants will be adults enrolled in a DMP for T2DM and/or CHD and living in North Rhine-Westphalia, a state of the Federal Republic of Germany. Study participants will be recruited with the assistance of their general practitioners by the end of June 2021. Evaluation will be performed as a pragmatic randomised controlled trial with one intervention group and one waiting control group. The intervention group will receive the intervention for 18 months. During this time, the waiting control group will continue with usual care and the usual measures of their DMPs. After 18 months, the waiting control group will also receive a shortened intervention. The primary outcome is number of hospital days. In addition, the effects on self-reported health-state, physical activity, nutrition, and eight different psychological variables will be investigated. Differences between values at month 18 and at the beginning will be compared to judge the effectiveness of the intervention."

IR occurs in hepatic cells when the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1)/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) signaling pathway is downregulated; thus, activating this pathway can significantly improve insulin sensitivity and ameliorate T2DM. Tetrahedral framework nucleic acids (tFNAs), a DNA nanomaterial, are synthesized from four single-stranded DNA molecules. tFNAs possess excellent biocompatibility and good water solubility and stability. tFNAs can promote cell proliferation, cell autophagy, wound healing, and nerve regeneration by activating the PI3K/Akt pathway. Herein, we explore the effects and underlying mechanisms of tFNAs on IR. The results displayed that tFNAs could increase glucose uptake and ameliorate IR by activating the IRS-1/PI3K/Akt pathway in glucosamine (GlcN)-stimulated HepG2 cells. By employing a PI3K inhibitor, we confirmed that tFNAs reduce IR through the PI3K/Akt pathway. Moreover, tFNAs can promote hepatic cell proliferation and inhibit GlcN-induced cell apoptosis. In a T2DM mouse model, tFNAs reduce blood glucose levels and ameliorate hepatic IR <i>via</i> the PI3K/Akt pathway. Taken together, tFNAs can improve hepatic IR and alleviate T2DM through the PI3K/Akt pathway, making contribution to the potential application of tFNAs in T2DM."

We assessed add-on therapeutic effects of DPP-4I anagliptin in Japanese T2DM patients treated with metformin, an α-GI miglitol, or both drugs on postprandial responses of GLP-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), and on plasma concentration of the appetite-suppressing hormone leptin. Forty-two Japanese T2DM patients with inadequately controlled disease (HbA1c: 6.5%-8.0%) treated with metformin (n=14), miglitol (n=14) or a combination of the two drugs (n=14) received additional treatment with anagliptin (100mg, p.o., b.i.d.) for 52 weeks. We assessed glycemic control, postprandial responses of GLP-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), and on plasma concentration of leptin in those patients. Add-on therapy with anagliptin for 52 weeks improved glycemic control and increased the area under the curve of biologically active GLP-1 concentration without altering obesity indicators. Total GIP concentration at 52 weeks was reduced by add-on therapy in groups treated with miglitol compared with those treated with metformin. Add-on therapy reduced leptin concentrations.

31318152,Review of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in patients with chronic kidney disease and their renal effects.,['2型糖尿病'],['Lance A Sloan'],"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is the most common cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD), and when it causes CKD it is collectively referred to as diabetic kidney disease. One of the newer therapies for managing hyperglycemia is the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) drug class. This review summarizes the effects of GLP-1RAs in patients with T2DM with CKD and evidence for renoprotection with GLP-1RAs using data from observational studies, prospective clinical trials, post hoc analyses, and meta-analyses. Evidence from some preclinical studies was also reviewed. Taken together, subgroup analyses of patients with varying degrees of renal function demonstrated that glycemic control with GLP-1RAs was not markedly less effective in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment vs that in patients with normal function. GLP-1RAs were associated with improvements in some cardiorenal risk factors, including systolic blood pressure and body weight. Furthermore, several large cardiovascular outcome studies showed reduced risks of composite renal outcomes, mostly driven by a reduction in macroalbuminuria, suggesting potential renoprotective effects of GLP-1RAs. In conclusion, GLP-1RAs effectively reduced hyperglycemia in patients with mild or moderately impaired kidney function in the limited number of studies to date. GLP-1RAs may be considered in combination with other glucose-lowering medications because of their ability to lower glucose in a glucose-dependent manner, lowering their risk for hypoglycemia, while improving some cardiorenal risk factors. Potential renoprotective effects of GLP-1RAs, and their renal mechanisms of action, warrant further investigation."

Rob tool in the Cochrane handbook was performed to evaluate the methodological quality of all included studies. Relevant information and statistics were abstracted and synthesized in Review Manager 5.4 to evaluate the efficacy of combination treatment. Sensitivity analyses and subgroup analyses were used to analyse the sources of heterogeneity. Publication bias analyses were performed by Stata software to assess the robustness and quality of the outcomes. As a result, a total of 12 eligible RCTs with 1307 T2DM participants from 7 electronic databases were included. Combined CHF with metformin treatment showed better efficacies than metformin monotherapy in regulating the structure of the gut microbiota, characterized by increased Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus and Bacteroidetes and decreased Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcus, and Saccharomyces along with better decreases in glycated haemoglobin, fasting plasma glucose, 2-hour postprandial blood glucose, fasting insulin and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance. Subgroup analyses further analysed the effect of metformin doses and CHF classifications on controlling hyperglycaemia and altering the gut microbiota. In conclusion, our meta-analysis suggested that combined CHF with metformin treatment is promising for the modulation of the gut microbiota along with ameliorating hyperglycemia in T2DM patients. Importantly, more well-designed RCTs are needed to validate the outcomes and verify the treatment value for clinical purposes."

New potential and prognostic biomarkers are urgently required to identify individuals at high risk of β-cell dysfunction and pre-DM. The DNA-sensing stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is an important component of innate immune signaling that governs inflammation-mediated T2DM. NOD-like receptor (NLR) reduces STING-dependent innate immune activation in response to cyclic di-GMP and DNA viruses by impeding STING-TBK1 interaction. We proposed exploring novel blood-based mRNA signatures that are selective for components related to inflammatory, immune, and metabolic stress which may reveal the landscape of T2DM progression for diagnosing or treating patients in the pre-DM state. In this study, we used microarray data set to identify a group of differentially expressed mRNAs related to the cGAS/STING, NODlike receptor pathways (NLR) and T2DM. Then, we comparatively analyzed six mRNAs expression levels in healthy individuals, prediabetes (pre-DM) and T2DM patients by real-time PCR. The expressions of ZBP1, DDX58, NFKB1 and CHUK were significantly higher in the pre-DM group compared to either healthy control or T2DM patients. The expression of ZBP1 and NFKB1 mRNA could discriminate between good versus poor glycemic control groups. HSPA1B mRNA showed a significant difference in its expression regarding the insulin resistance. Linear regression analysis revealed that LDLc, HSPA1B and NFKB1 were significant variables for the prediction of pre-DM from the healthy control.

Two hundred patients with T2DM were studied (age M = 70.21 years, SD = 6.63 years). The median degree of disease acceptance was 29 (min-max = 8-40) and the median level of adherence was 24 (min-max = 13-28). Disease acceptance was a significant (<i>p</i> = 0.002) independent predictor of the odds of qualifying for non-adherence OR = 0.903, 95% CI = 0.846-0.963. The respondents gave the lowest scores for glycemic control (Mdn = 38.99, min-max = 8.33-150), and health control (Mdn = 55.88, min-max = 11.76-100). A one-way ANOVA showed that the non-adhering patients were significantly older compared to the adherence group and were taking significantly more diabetes pills per day. The level of disease acceptance was average, but it turned out to be an independent predictor of adherence. Therefore, it is justified to use psychological and behavioral interventions that are aimed at increasing the level of diabetes acceptance in elderly people with T2DM.

In this article, we provide a synoptic view on potential mechanisms and relevant factors underlying menstrual cycle disorders and fertility issues in women with T2DM. The article discusses the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis, the central role of the hypothalamus in the homeostasis of this system, the central modulators of the axis, and the peripheral metabolic signals involved in neuroendocrine control of reproduction. The available literature on the relationship between T2DM and the female reproductive lifespan, menstrual cycle disorders, fertility issues, and gestational health in women with T2DM are also discussed. The data so far indicate that there is a ""U-shaped"" relationship between menarche, menopause, and T2DM, both early and late menarche/menopause being risk factors for T2DM. Hyperglycemia and its consequences may be responsible for the effects of T2DM on reproductive health in women, but the exact mechanisms are not as yet fully understood; thus, more studies are needed in order to identify factors causing disruption of the HPO axis."

The incidence of both diabetes and dementia has increased simultaneously. Researchers have found that a large proportion of dementia patients have T2DM. In recent years, increasing evidence has demonstrated a link between cognitive decline and T2DM. Although the exact pathogenesis of cognitive impairment in T2DM is still unknown, current studies suggest that hyperglycemia, cerebrovascular disease, brain insulin resistance, and changes in γ-aminobutyric acid (GABAergic) neurons may mediate the association between T2DM and cognitive impairment. These potential mechanisms may become targets for the treatment of cognitive disorders in patients with T2DM. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), a widely used anti-diabetic drug, has been shown to not only effectively lower blood glucose but also improve neurological function. Previous research has confirmed that GLP-1 and its analogues are effective in the treatment of cognitive impairment in patients with T2DM. This review describes current evidence on the mechanisms underlying the association between T2DM and cognitive impairment. In particular, this review focuses on recent advances in GLP-1 and its analogues for the treatment of T2DM-related cognitive impairment."

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether genetic variations in the SLC22A1, SLC22A2, and SLC47A1 genes could be associated with an altered response to metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. A cohort study was conducted in 308 individuals with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus of less than 3 years and who had metformin monotherapy. Three measurements of blood glycated hemoglobin (HbA<sub>1c</sub> ) were obtained at the beginning of the study and after 6 and 12 months. Five polymorphisms were analyzed in the SLC22A1 (rs622342, rs628031, rs594709), SLC22A2 (rs316019), and SLC47A1 (rs2289669) genes by real-time polymerase chain reaction. The results showed a significant association among genotypes CC-rs622342 (β = 1.36; P < .001), AA-rs628031 (β = 0.98; P = .032), and GG-rs594709 (β = 1.21; P = .016) in the SLC22A1 gene with an increase in HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels during the follow-up period. Additionally, a significant association was found in the CGA and CAG haplotypes with an increase in HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels compared to the highest-frequency haplotype (AGA). In conclusion, the genetic variation in the SLC22A1 gene was significantly related to the variation of the HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels, an important indicator of glycemic control in diabetic patients. This information may contribute to identifying patients with an altered response to metformin before starting their therapy."

The primary endpoint was the change in interleukin-6 from baseline to 24 weeks. Secondary endpoints were evaluation of the gut microbiota in feces and blood, fecal organic acids, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, lipopolysaccharide-binding protein, and glycemic control. Synbiotic administration for 24 weeks did not significantly affect changes in interleukin-6 from baseline to 24 weeks (0.35 ± 1.99 vs. -0.24 ± 1.75 pg/mL, respectively). Relative to baseline, however, at 24 weeks after synbiotic administration there were positive changes in the counts of <i>Bifidobacterium</i> and total lactobacilli, the relative abundances of <i>Bifidobacterium</i> species such as <i>Bifidobacterium adolescentis</i> and <i>Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum</i>, and the concentrations of acetic and butyric acids in feces. No significant changes in inflammatory markers were found in the synbiotic group compared to the control group.

This subgroup analysis of patients with liver impairment used the final 3-year results. Data on patients, adverse drug reactions (ADRs), and changes in glycemic parameters and liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alanine aminotransferase [ALT], gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase [γ-GTP] and alkaline phosphatase [ALP]) were collected, and the fatty liver index (FLI) was calculated. In the effectiveness analysis (n = 8,763), baseline liver function was normal in 2,605 patients (ALT <31/<21 U/L [men/women]) and abnormal in 3,277 (ALT ≥31/≥21 U/L). The abnormal liver function group had higher mean body weight and BMI than the normal liver function group (p < 0.001). In the safety analysis (n = 11,051), urinary tract infections, genital infections and hepatic disorders were more common in the abnormal than normal liver function group (2.25% vs. 1.07%; 1.78% vs. 1.14% and 1.85% vs. 1.01%). In the abnormal liver function group, there were significant (p < 0.001) decreases from baseline at 36 months in AST and ALT (from 38.8 and 53.7 U/L to 29.3 and 37.7 U/L, respectively), γ-GTP (from 75.4 to 51.7 U/L) and ALP (from 254.8 to 234.5 U/L), which were greater than in the normal liver function group. FLI reductions at 36 months were significant (p < 0.001) in subgroups with baseline FLI of ≥30 or ≥60. In conclusion, ipragliflozin improved liver function over 3 years in patients with impaired liver function, although ADRs occurred more frequently than in the normal liver function group."
