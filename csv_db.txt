32167193,Do motor coordination and sleep difficulties predict peer functioning in children and adolescents with attention-deficit and hyperactivity disorder after accounting for existing ADHD symptomology?,"['attention-deficit and hyperactivity disorder', 'motor coordination', 'motor skills', 'peer problems', 'peer relationships']","['Vincent O Mancini', 'Kathryn E Althorpe', 'Wai Chen']","[""Children with attention-deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are more likely to experience peer problems compared to their non-ADHD peers, though ADHD-specific symptoms only partially explain this association. This study examined whether sleep difficulties and motor coordination problems are additional predictors of peer problems in an ADHD population. An ADHD sample of 72 participants aged 6-14\xa0years (M\xa0=\xa09.86\xa0years, SD\xa0=\xa01.79\xa0years) was evaluated for an association of peer problems with measures of motor coordination, sleep difficulties as well as ADHD and comorbidity symptoms. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis (HMRA) was used to test the current study aims. Motor coordination, but not sleep difficulties, predicted additional variance in peer problems after controlling for inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, internalizing problems, oppositionality, and conduct problems. Poor motor coordination predicts peer problems beyond ADHD symptoms. Clinicians seeking to improve peer functioning in children with ADHD should also consider motor coordination difficulties in addition to existing treatment strategies. Statement of contribution What is already known Children with attention-deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) experience greater peer problems (i.e., making friends, being victimized, participating in play) than their typically developing peers. Previous studies have attributed this association between ADHD and peer problems to the symptoms of ADHD (i.e., inattention and/or hyperactivity) disrupting the typical trajectory of social development. However, quantitative studies have identified that symptoms of ADHD predict only portion of the variance in a child's peer problems - highlighting that there may be other unique factors that contribute to the higher incidence of peer problems typically observed in this population. What this study adds This study tested whether additional theoretically relevant factors could predict levels of peer problems in children with ADHD beyond the primary symptoms of the disorder. Internalizing symptomatology, conduct problems, oppositionality, motor coordination, and sleep difficulties were added to a regression model already including inattention and hyperactivity symptoms. These factors explained 51% of the variability in peer problems. In this sample of 72 ADHD children, the results of the final model highlighted that only motor coordination and conduct problems remained significant predictors of peer problems - highlighting two potentially important target areas for screening and intervention.""]"

A structured diagnostic interview specific to ADHD provides a globally agreed-on standard of evaluation. These interviews are accessible in the public domain in multiple languages and are helpful to clinicians new to the diagnosis of ADHD. Broad-based rating scales looking at multiple domains of psychopathology are critical to assuring recognition of comorbid diagnoses, which might otherwise be missed, differential diagnoses, and identification of the most prominent or treatable diagnosis. Recent innovations in computerized adaptive testing have improved the efficiency and accuracy of diagnostic screening. Rating scales specific to ADHD and disruptive behavior disorders establish the severity of the disorder and response to intervention. Age- and gender-normed symptom rating scales for ADHD capture clinically salient differences between what is normative in different demographic groups. An evaluation of functional impairment in ADHD has been critical to understanding the patient's perspective of the presenting problem. Best practice care for ADHD treatment goes beyond improvement to well-defined standards for both symptom and functional remission. Studies of executive function, emotional regulation, mind-wandering, and sluggish cognitive tempo have led to a richer understanding of the breadth and depth of associated deficits commonly experienced by ADHD patients.

Due to its high comorbidity and high harm, it has received increasing attention. It causes damage to functions in multiple areas, and this damage may continue into adulthood. ADHD is a common developmental disorder characterized by persistent attention deficit and hyperactivity/impulsivity. ADHD often merges with other diseases, such as oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, personality disorder, anxiety disorder, mood disorder, and substance dependence. The disease tends to cause children with learning difficulties, poor grades, strained relationships with family members and children of the same age, lack of self-esteem, and children with low occupation, low income, substance abuse, and antisocial personality characteristics when they grow up to adults. Many countries have formulated ADHD treatment guidelines for this purpose, but there is still a lack of consensus.

In contrast with many European countries, the identification and management of adult ADHD remains underdeveloped in France, and a subject of controversy. This review provides a practical update on current knowledge about ADHD in adults for French-speaking professionals who have to detect or manage adult patients with ADHD. ADHD is classified as a neurodevelopmental disorder in the recent update of the international diagnostic classification. While symptoms and impairment due to ADHD are frequently severe during childhood, they often evolve as children grow older, with frequent persistent disabilities in adulthood. In adulthood, the clinical presentation, as in childhood, involves the symptom triad of inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity. However, differences are noted: hyperactivity is more often internalized, symptoms of inattention may be masked by anxiety symptoms or obsessive-like compensation strategies. ADHD is often diagnosed during childhood, but it is not rare for the diagnosis to be made later. Failure to recognise symptoms resulting in misdiagnosis, or alternatively well-developed compensation factors could be two underlying reasons for the long delay until diagnosis. Other symptoms, such as emotional deregulation or executive function-related symptoms are also usually observed in adults. In addition, in adults, ADHD is often associated with other psychiatric disorders (in 80% of cases); this makes the diagnosis even more difficult. These disorders encompass a broad spectrum, from mood disorders (unipolar or bipolar), to anxiety disorders, and other neurodevelopmental disorders and personality disorders, especially borderline and antisocial personality disorder. Substance-use disorders are very common, either as a consequence of impulsivity and emotional dysregulation or as an attempt at self-treatment. Sleep disorders, especially restless leg syndrome and hypersomnolence, could share common pathophysiological mechanisms with ADHD. ADHD and comorbidity-related symptoms are responsible for serious functional impairment, in various domains, leading to academic, social, vocational, and familial consequences. The impact on other psychiatric disorders as an aggravating factor should also be considered. The considerable disability and the poorer quality of life among adults with ADHD warrant optimal evaluation and management. The diagnostic procedure for ADHD among adults should be systematic. Once the positive diagnosis is made, the evaluation enables characterisation of the levels of severity and impairment at individual level. A full examination should also assess medical conditions associated with ADHD, to provide personalized care. In recent years, a growing number of assessment tools have been translated and validated in French providing a wide range of structured interviews and standardized self-report questionnaires for the evaluation of core and associated ADHD symptoms, comorbidities and functional impairment. The treatment of ADHD in adults is multimodal, and aims to relieve the symptoms, limit the burden of the disease, and manage comorbidities. The most relevant and validated psychological approaches are psycho-education, cognitive-behavioural therapy and ""third wave therapies"" with a specific focus on emotional regulation. Cognitive remediation and neurofeedback are promising strategies still under evaluation. Medications, especially psychostimulants, are effective for alleviating ADHD symptoms with a large effect size. Their safety and tolerance are satisfactory, although their long-term clinical benefit is still under discussion. In France, methylphenidate is the only stimulant available for the treatment of ADHD. Unfortunately, there is no authorization for its use among adults except in continuation after adolescence. Hence the prescription, which is subject to the regulations on narcotics, is off-label in France. This article aims to provide practical considerations for the management of ADHD and associated disorders in adults, in this particular French context.']"

ADHD impairments arise from irregularities primarily in dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE) circuits within the prefrontal cortex. Due to ADHD medication's controversial side effects and high rates of diagnosis, alternative/complementary pharmacological therapeutic approaches for ADHD are needed. Although the number of publications that study the potential effects of caffeine consumption on ADHD treatment have been accumulating over the last years, and caffeine has recently been used in ADHD research in the context of animal models, an updated evidence-based systematic review on the effects of caffeine on ADHD-like symptoms in animal studies is lacking. To provide insight and value at the preclinical level, a systematic review based on PRISMA guidelines was performed for all publications available up to 1 September 2021. Caffeine treatment increases attention and improves learning, memory, and olfactory discrimination without altering blood pressure and body weight. These results are supported at the neuronal/molecular level. Nonetheless, the role of caffeine in modulating ADHD-like symptoms of hyperactivity and impulsivity is contradictory, raising discrepancies that require further clarification.

Despite mounting human and animal research, the neurological pathways underlying ASD and ADHD are still not well understood. Scientists investigate neurodevelopmental disorders by using animal models that have high similarities in genetics and behaviours with humans. Mice have been utilized in neuroscience research as an excellent animal model for a long time; however, the zebrafish has attracted much attention recently, with an increasingly large number of studies using this model. In this review, we first discuss ASD and ADHD aetiology from a general point of view to their characteristics and treatments.

Children 8-13 were recruited in three groups: 23 ADHD+PAE, 19 familial ADHD-PAE, and 28 typically developing controls (TD). Neurobehavioral instruments included the Conners 3 Parent Behavior Rating Scale and the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS). Two dimensional magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging was acquired from supraventricular white matter to measure N-acetylaspartate compounds, glutamate, creatine\u2009+\u2009phosphocreatine (creatine), and choline-compounds (choline). Whole brain diffusion tensor imaging was acquired and used to to calculate fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity, and radial diffusivity from the same superventricular white matter regions that produced magnetic resonance spectroscopy data. The Conners 3 Parent Hyperactivity/Impulsivity Score, glutamate, mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity, and radial diffusivity were all higher in ADHD+PAE than ADHD-PAE. Glutamate was lower in ADHD-PAE than TD. Within ADHD+PAE, inferior performance on the D-KEFS Tower Test correlated with higher neurometabolite levels. These findings suggest white matter differences between the PAE and familial etiologies of ADHD. Abnormalities detected by magnetic resonance spectroscopy and diffusion tensor imaging co-localize in supraventricular white matter and are relevant to executive function symptoms of ADHD.']"

31177787,Novel approach to evaluate central autonomic regulation in attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).,[],"['N Sekaninova', 'M Mestanik', 'A Mestanikova', 'A Hamrakova', 'I Tonhajzerova']","[""Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most commonly diagnosed developmental disorders in childhood characterized by hyperactivity, impulsivity and inattention. ADHD manifests in the child's development by deficits in cognitive, executive and perceptor-motor functions, emotional regulation and social adaptation. Although the exact cause has not yet been known, the crucial role in the development of this disease plays the interaction of genetic, neurobiological and epigenetic factors. According to current knowledge, ADHD is defined as a biological dysfunction of central nervous system with genetically or organically defined deficits in noradrenergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission associated with structural abnormalities, especially in prefronto-striatal regions. In this context, a significant part of the difficulties could be due to a faulty control of fronto-striato-thalamo-cortical circuits important for attention, arousal and executive functions. Moreover, ADHD is associated with abnormal autonomic regulation. Specifically, reduced cardiac-linked parasympathetic activity associated with relative sympathetic dominance indexed by low heart rate variability can represent a noninvasive marker for prefrontal hypoactivity. However, the mechanisms underlying altered autonomic regulation in ADHD are still unknown. In this aspect, the evaluation of central autonomic regulation by noninvasive methods, namely pupillometry and eye-tracking, may provide novel information for better understanding of the neurobiological pathomechanisms leading to ADHD.""]"

ADHD and SUD also frequently co-occur in treatment-seeking adolescents, which complicates diagnosis and treatment and is associated with poor treatment outcomes. Research on the effect of treatment of childhood ADHD on the prevention of adolescent SUD is inconclusive, and studies on the diagnosis and treatment of adolescents with ADHD and SUD are scarce. Thus, the available evidence is generally not sufficient to justify robust treatment recommendations. <i>Objective:</i> The aim of the study was to obtain a consensus statement based on a combination of scientific data and clinical experience. <i>Method:</i> A modified Delphi study to reach consensus based upon the combination of scientific data and clinical experience with a multidisciplinary group of 55 experts from 17 countries. The experts were asked to rate a set of statements on the effect of treatment of childhood ADHD on adolescent SUD and on the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of adolescents with comorbid ADHD and SUD. <i>Results:</i> After 3 iterative rounds of rating and adapting 37 statements, consensus was reached on 36 of these statements representing 6 domains: general (<i>n</i> = 4), risk of developing SUD (<i>n</i> = 3), screening and diagnosis (<i>n</i> = 7), psychosocial treatment (<i>n</i> = 5), pharmacological treatment (<i>n</i> = 11), and complementary treatments (<i>n</i> = 7). Routine screening is recommended for ADHD in adolescent patients in substance abuse treatment and for SUD in adolescent patients with ADHD in mental healthcare settings. Long-acting stimulants are recommended as the first-line treatment of ADHD in adolescents with concurrent ADHD and SUD, and pharmacotherapy should preferably be embedded in psychosocial treatment. The only remaining no-consensus statement concerned the requirement of abstinence before starting pharmacological treatment in adolescents with ADHD and concurrent SUD. In contrast to the majority, some experts required full abstinence before starting any pharmacological treatment, some were against the use of stimulants in the treatment of these patients (independent of abstinence), while some were against the alternative use of bupropion. <i>Conclusion:</i> This international consensus statement can be used by clinicians and patients together in a shared decision-making process to select the best interventions and to reach optimal outcomes in adolescent patients with concurrent ADHD and SUD.']"

Many questions remain regarding the long-term safety and effectiveness of these interventions; thus more research is needed to help clinicians evaluate the risk-benefit ratio for preschoolers with ADHD. As this body of knowledge grows, providers should consider the level of impairment caused by current symptoms in the risk-benefit analysis. Families should be educated not just about potential effects of medication but known complications of untreated ADHD; parents will likely not fully appreciate the long-term psychological effects of chronic behavioral problems and underachievement on a young child.

I highlight causal factors, underlying mechanisms, developmental trajectories, and female manifestations of ADHD, integrating the psychobiological underpinnings of this syndrome with contextual factors related to its clinical presentation, impairments, and soaring increases in diagnosed prevalence. Indeed, despite strong heritability, ADHD is expressed via transactional patterns of influence linked to family-, school-, peer-, neighborhood-, and policy-related factors. Moreover, intervention strategies must take into account both pharmacologic and behavioral modalities if the goal is to enhance competencies, rather than symptom reduction per se. A comprehensive understanding of ADHD mandates multiple levels of analysis-spanning genes, neurotransmission, brain pathways, individual skill levels, family socialization, peer relationships, and educational and cultural forces-which must be integrated and synthesized to surpass reductionist accounts, reduce stigma, and maximize the impact of prevention- and intervention-related efforts.']"

When controlled data are unavailable, the authors have included open-label and observational studies. <b>Expert opinion</b>: ED in adult patients with ADHD is a very common and impairing problem that can be treated with stimulants or atomoxetine. ADHD studies in adults with other neurodevelopment disorders are scarce; stimulants seem to be the most effective and safe drugs in treating ADHD symptoms, without worsening the core features of other neurodevelopmental disorders. In patients with ADHD and comorbid BD, the treatment of BD alone may result in residual symptoms of ADHD. Patients should be treated hierarchically: BD should be treated first, while ADHD should be treated combining ADHD medications and mood stabilizers after mood stabilization. The available evidence for treating patients with ADHD and comorbid ADs in adults supports the idea of an anti-anxiety/ADHD-specific treatment association.']"

In addition, both ADHD presentations had higher inattention scores than TD. ADHD adolescents performed worse than TD in processing speed, concentration and accuracy. ADHD groups showed more impulsivity and inattention than TD. Digit Span and Symbol Search (WISC-IV) and processing speed and accuracy (d2) successfully classified ADHD and TD in children, but in adolescents, only coding (WISC-IV) and accuracy (d2) successfully classified ADHD presentations and TD. The WISC-IV and d2 yield neuropsychological profiles which reflect age-related cognitive changes and may allow the adaptation of more tailored early interventions for ADHD.']"

Recently, increasing numbers of research studies have begun to investigate the associations between neural and behavioral manifestations of ADHD. This review summarizes recent research on the perception of time in ADHD and proposes that this symptom is a possible diagnostic characteristic. Controlled studies on time perception have compared individuals with ADHD with typically developing controls (TDCs) and have used methods that include the Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory (ZTPI). Practical approaches to time perception and its evaluation have shown that individuals with ADHD have difficulties in time estimation and discrimination activities as well as having the feeling that time is passing by without them being able to complete tasks accurately and well. Although ADHD has been associated with neurologic abnormalities in the mesolimbic and dopaminergic systems, recent studies have found that when individuals with ADHD are treated medically, their perception of time tends to normalize. The relationship between ADHD and the perception of time requires greater attention. Further studies on time perception in ADHD with other abnormalities, including executive function, might be approaches that refine the classification and diagnosis of ADHD and should include studies on its varied presentation in different age groups.']"

The present study assessed mathematical achievement on a basic number skill test and on an arithmetic fact retrieval task. Besides math achievement, self-ratings of ADHD symptoms (attention deficits, hyperactivity, impulsivity), core executive functions (inhibition, cognitive flexibility, working memory capacity, global index) and state anxiety in 646 fourth and fifth grade students (48.1 % girls) were measured. CEF was evaluated by means of a tablet-based test. Regression analysis showed different predictors for both math abilities. While all CEF measures, inattention and impulsivity self-ratings predicted basic number skills, only inhibition, WMC and inattention self-rating were predictors of arithmetic fact retrieval. On the basis of a cluster analysis of ADHD self-ratings and CEF performance, three different groups were identified: 1: low ADHD, average CEF; 2: high ADHD, low CEF; 3: moderate ADHD, high CEF. Cluster 2 showed scores below the mean in both math scores, whereas cluster 3 exhibited performances above the mean in both math scores. No math differences were found between cluster 1 and 3. The data yield evidence that the association between CEF and math achievement depends on the specific math skill and test type. The results underline the importance of differentiating between CEF components and specific math abilities. Implications for future research on the associations between mathematics, ADHD and CEF are discussed.']"

The current study explored the utility of integrating an eye tracker with a commercially available continuous performance test (CPT), the MOXO-dCPT. As part of the study, the performance of adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) patients and healthy controls (<i>n</i> = 43, <i>n</i> = 42, respectively) was compared in the integrated system. More specifically, the MOXO-dCPT has four stages, which differ in their combinations of ecological visual and auditory dynamic distractors. By exploring the participants' performance in each of the stages, we were able to show that: (a) ADHD patients spend significantly more time gazing at irrelevant areas of interest (AOIs) compared to healthy controls; (b) visual distractors are particularly effective in impacting ADHD patients' eye movements, suggesting their enhanced utility in diagnostic procedures; (c) combining gaze direction data and conventional CPT indices enhances group prediction, compared to the sole use of conventional indices. Overall, the findings indicate the utility of eye tracker-integrated CPTs and their enhanced diagnostic precision. They also suggest that the use of attention-grabbing visual distractors may be a promising path for the evolution of existing CPTs by shortening their duration and enhancing diagnostic precision.""]"

In a randomized placebo-controlled double-blind crossover design, 27 children with ADHD were scanned twice with resting-state functional MRI and sustained attention was examined using a continuous performance task under methylphenidate and placebo conditions; 49 matched typically-developing (TD) children were scanned once for comparison. Dynamic time-varying cross-network interactions between the salience (SN), frontoparietal (FPN), and default mode (DMN) networks were examined in children with ADHD under both administration conditions and compared with TD children. Methylphenidate improved sustained attention on a continuous performance task in children with ADHD, when compared to the placebo condition. Children with ADHD under placebo showed aberrancies in dynamic time-varying cross-network interactions between the SN, FPN and DMN, which were remediated by methylphenidate. Multivariate classification analysis confirmed that methylphenidate remediates aberrant dynamic brain network interactions. Furthermore, dynamic time-varying network interactions under placebo conditions predicted individual differences in methylphenidate-induced improvements in sustained attention in children with ADHD.

Contrary to previous findings, ADHD comorbidity had no impact on the age of OCD onset, and the severity of OCD symptoms was lower in ADHD. With ADHD comorbidity, the OCD symptom course tended to be chronically stable, which may have resulted in complaints persisting into adulthood. In ADHD-free patients, contamination, doubt, religious, somatic obsessions, and cleaning were all more common than in those with ADHD. There was a positive correlation between compulsion scores and the severity of ADHD symptoms, which may be related to increased compulsive coping in ADHD. Impulsivity or compulsivity dominance in the symptom presentation of OCD-ADHD comorbidity may determine phenomenological distinctions such as whether concurrent traits are more prone to tics, conduct problems, or internalizing problems. The primordial associations for clinical characteristics, which were independently associated with ADHD comorbidity, were adjusted using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Clinical variables such as being male, absence of cleaning compulsion, the existence of concurrent conduct problems, tic disorders, and dyslexia, as well as longer treatment duration and poorer treatment response, were all independent predictors of ADHD comorbidity. With an 80.8% accurate classification and relatively fine goodness-of-fit model, the regression model consisting of those predictors had good predictiveness for ADHD comorbidity (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup>\u2009=\u20090.543). <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> The close association between pediatric OCD, ADHD, and tic disorders can be defined as a specific subtype of pediatric OCD, characterized by more conduct problems, a chronically stable course of OCD symptoms, and poorer treatment outcomes.

However, this complex interaction is only partially understood so far. This review presents current knowledge about the association of ADHD with antisociality and the development of delinquent behavior. Thereby, the relationships between ADHD, conduct disorder and antisocial personality disorder in offenders are discussed, as well as the impact of comorbid psychiatric disorders and psychosocial conditions on offending behavior. Also, treatment studies in offender populations with ADHD are presented. Although our understanding of the role of ADHD in the development of criminal behavior has substantially improved during the last two decades, more research is needed to further elucidate the mechanisms generating unfavorable outcomes and to engender adequate treatment strategies for this population at risk.

The objective of this study was to assess attrition from military service in newly accessed active component service members diagnosed with ADHD as compared to controls. In addition, attrition rates and incidence rates of mental health diagnoses were assessed in service members with ADHD by treatment status (i.e., treated vs untreated ADHD) where treatment was defined as being dispensed an FDA-approved ADHD medication at least twice within 181 days. Almost two-thirds (64.8%) of newly accessed ADHD cases in 2014 were identified after enlistment medical screening at Military Entrance Processing Stations (MEPS) (i.e., post-MEPS).

For the two-by-two factorial, observer-blinded, multicenter, randomized controlled Comparison of Methylphenidate and Psychotherapy in Adult ADHD Study (COMPAS; ISRCTN54096201), 419 outpatients with ADHD were considered for analysis. ADHD symptoms were assessed by blind observer-rated and patient-rated Conners Adult ADHD Rating Scales before treatment (T1), 13 weeks (T2) and 26 weeks (T3) after T1, at treatment completion after 52 weeks (T4), and at follow-up (130 weeks, T5). MPH was superior to PLB in improving symptoms of inattention at almost all endpoints (observer-rated T2, T3, T4, T5; patient-rated T2, T3, T4), while a significant decrease in hyperactivity and impulsivity was at first found after 6 months of treatment. CM compared to GPT decreased inattention and impulsivity in the early treatment phase only (observer-rated T2, patient-rated T2, T3). In conclusion, while MPH seems to have a direct and sustained effect on inattention, premature medication discontinuation should particularly be avoided in patients with hyperactive-impulsive symptoms. Also, especially in high inattention and/or impulsivity presentations, initial individual patient management might be beneficial. Consequently, considering individual core symptom profiles may enhance the efficacy of treatments in adult ADHD.""]"

Second, we assessed decision-making strategies with a Bayesian latent mixture analysis and found that ADHD-related decision-making deficits are characterized by the use of less complex strategies. That is, adolescent boys with ADHD, relative to TD adolescent boys, less often adopted strategies in which all characteristics relevant to make an optimal decision were integrated.

However, transdiagnostic comparisons between ASD and ADHD is complicated due to the sex differences within each condition. To clarify the similarities and differences in the cognitive functioning between ASD and ADHD, while considering potential sex differences, this study compared cognitive profiles assessed by the WAIS-III between the four groups created by orthogonally combining diagnosis and sex based on the data from 277 ASD males, 86 ASD females, 99 ADHD males and 64 ADHD females. The analysis revealed three major findings. First, performance IQ and perceptual organization index were higher in ADHD males than in ASD males and ADHD females. Second, Gaussian mixture model fitting revealed two clusters underlying the distribution of subindex scores. The percentage of being classified into the cluster that scored lower in all the subindices was higher in females than in males irrespective of diagnosis. Third, feature importance for classification of ASD and ADHD yielded by random forest classifier, a supervised machine learning algorithm, revealed that autism quotient was most informative feature in classifying ASD and ADHD in males, while the discrepancy between verbal and performance intelligence quotient was in females, indicating that the set of behavioral features contributing to classification differs between males and females. Thus, these findings indicate that sex as well as diagnosis is critical in determining the cognitive profiles of people with ASD and ADHD. LAY SUMMARY: The present study compared profiles of cognitive functions measured by Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale between males and females with ASD and ADHD. The analyses revealed clear sex differences in cognitive functions in both ASD and ADHD and that the set of cognitive functions useful in classifying ASD and ADHD differed between males and females. Thus, biological sex seems to be a critical factor in determining the cognitive profiles of people with ASD and ADHD.']"

Findings from the National Czech Study.,[],"['Radek Ptáček', 'Martina Vňuková', 'Filip Děchtěrenko', 'Simon Weissenberger', 'Eva Kitzlerová', 'Hana Ptáčková', 'Martin Anders']","['BACKGROUND Studies show neurological differences between patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and healthy controls. Furthermore, it is possible that poor timing is linked with impairments in neural circuitry. This study aimed to test the hypothesis that there is a difference in time perception between adults with severe ADHD symptomatology and adults with no ADHD symptomatology. MATERIAL AND METHODS Previously, we collected data from a more extensive set of participants (n=1518) concerning the prevalence of ADHD in adulthood. We recruited participants from 3 groups defined by increasing ADHD severity out of this participant pool. Each participant was presented with 2 experimental tasks (in counterbalanced order): duration estimation and duration discrimination. RESULTS In general, we did not find any specific differences in time perception related to the severity of ADHD. Regarding duration estimation, we found that the difference between the actual and estimated durations increased with the actual duration (F(1, 7028.00)=2685.38, P<0.001). Although the differences between groups were not significant, the group×duration interaction was (F[1, 7028.00]=10.86, P<0.001), with a very small effect size (ηp²<0.001, 95% CI [0.00, 0.01]). CONCLUSIONS The results suggest that although individuals may demonstrate increased ADHD symptomatology, they may not have objectively more significant difficulties in time perception tasks than their counterparts with mild symptomatology. Nonetheless, time perception should be further studied because, as qualitative research suggests, participants with more severe ADHD symptomatology subjectively perceive more significant differences in time management in real life.']"

We identified clustering of non-coding SVs around neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathways, which are involved in neuronal brain function, and highly relevant to ADHD pathogenesis and regulation of gene expression related to specific ADHD phenotypes.

32126477,Association between tendencies for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and the 2D:4D digit ratio: a cross-cultural replication in Germany and China.,"['2D:4D digit ratio', 'Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) tendencies', 'Literature review', 'Prenatal testosterone', 'Replication']","['Jennifer Wernicke', 'Julia Tamara Zabel', 'Yingying Zhang', 'Benjamin Becker', 'Christian Montag']","['Prenatal testosterone is considered to be a possible factor contributing to the development of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptomatology, but findings regarding the connection between individual variations in prenatal testosterone exposure as (indirectly) indexed by the second-to-fourth digit (2D:4D) ratio and ADHD remain inconsistent. To clarify the inconsistent findings and to facilitate generalization on the association between subclinical variations in ADHD tendencies and lower 2D:4D ratios the current study applied a cross-cultural replication approach employing independent healthy adult cohorts from Germany and China. Samples from Germany and China were matched for gender and age (in each sample n<sub>males</sub>\u202f=\u202f96, n<sub>females</sub>\u202f=\u202f96; age<sub>Germany</sub>: M\u202f=\u202f21.47, SD\u202f=\u202f2.55; age<sub>China</sub>: M\u202f=\u202f21.36, SD\u202f=\u202f2.28). All participants filled in the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale Symptom Checklist (ASRS) and provided hand scans to measure 2D:4D ratios. The German sample had significantly higher 2D:4D ratios than the Chinese sample but in both samples males had significantly lower 2D:4D ratios than females. The hypothesised negative association between 2D:4D ratios and ADHD tendencies was observed on a descriptive level in German and Chinese males and with one exception in Chinese females. But only in German males correlations gained significance (range: r\u202f=\u202f-0.198 to r\u202f=\u202f-0.177). The observed effect sizes are in line with former research that was conducted in samples from different cultures. In future research on the connection between testosterone and ADHD not only prenatal but also postnatal testosterone as well as possible moderators like childhood maltreatment should be taken into account.']"

We proposed that excessive spontaneous mind wandering (MW-S) might reflect a component of psychopathology that distinguishes ADHD from BPD. Using a questionnaire measure of MW-S and an experience sampling method, we investigated MW-S in daily life, in 28 ADHD, 19 BPD, 22 comorbid ADHD+BPD, and 29 control females. The clinical groups reported heightened frequency and intensity of MW-S compared to controls, but no differences from each other. When controlling for depression and anxiety, significant differences only persisted between controls and ADHD, who also showed elevated intensity of MW-S compared to BPD and comorbid ADHD+BPD. We found no MW-S instability differences amongst clinical cases as well as cases versus controls. Negative content of MW-S was higher in BPD and comorbid ADHD+BPD compared to controls, with no differences between ADHD and controls. When controlling for depression/anxiety, the differences between BPD and comorbid ADHD+BPD and controls dissipated. MW-S is a trans-diagnostic process present in both ADHD and BPD. Yet, the underlying mechanisms of this experience may be driven by anxiety/depression in BPD but reflect a core process in ADHD.']"
